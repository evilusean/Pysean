Creating a repo that will allow me to build an astronomy app in python, I know I should technically be working on web development when I'm applying for tech jobs, but I can just build it in python, add my own changes, then use Flask/Vercel for backend and create a UI with React/JS/NextJS for frontend - and it will technically be a frontend project, plus I've been wanting to build something like this for a while, since the movement of the planets is predictable, it should be entirely math related, planets don't just randomly jump around retrograde - after learning this I can add on to it later on for moon phases, eclipses, yugas, 'special dates', etc</br>

Module 1: Starting with Python</br>
Begin your adventure with Python, starting from the very basics. You'll get acquainted with Python programming using Google Colab. Learn about variables, data types, control flow, f-strings, user inputs, and functions. This module lays a strong foundation for handling astronomical data efficiently.</br>

Module 2: Tabular Data Visualization</br>
Dive into the world of tabular data with tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This module teaches you to import libraries, analyze star color data, detect outliers, and create compelling visualizations like line plots and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams. It's all about making sense of complex astronomical datasets.</br>

Module 3: Image Data Visualization</br>
Explore the fascinating realm of astronomical image data. Learn about FITS files and use Python to bring galaxies like M31 to life on your screen. You'll delve into image processing techniques such as MinMax and ZScaleInterval scaling, enhancing your ability to interpret celestial images.</br>

Module 4: Image Processing | Apply Filters and Extracting Features</br>
This module takes you deeper into the world of image processing. Learn about convolution operations, Gaussian kernels, and feature enhancement. You'll discover techniques for identifying and extracting features from astronomical images, skills that are crucial for research and analysis.</br>

This course offers hand-on learning. It emphasizes a practical approach, filled with examples and real-world datasets. You will get step-by-step guidance. This ensures a solid understanding of each concept, regardless of your previous experience level.

Whether you're an astronomy enthusiast, a seasoned researcher, or a curious programmer, this course offers an opportunity to enhance your skills and dive into the world of astronomical data analysis.
