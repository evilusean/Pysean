It took me a few hours to get this figured out for Future Sean, but finally got it,
Saving all the steps I took here for Future Future Sean if anything breaks, So I don't spend hours fixing this, again :
First, Update Anki
Second, 'sudo pacman -S qt6-webengine' # idk if this did anything, but it was part of the process
Third, Get the addon 'Math Delimiters Replacer (Fixed)'	Code: '401047458', 'Anki' -> 'Tools' -> 'Addons' -> 'Add' -> Used the code
Converts simple dollar signs ($) you type into the working \(\dots\) and \[\dots\] format inside the Anki editor.

The only delimiters that worked reliably for bulk import (CSV) and general rendering on your system are the official LaTeX syntax, which bypasses potential conflicts with the dollar signs ($).

Format	Delimiter (For CSV Import)	Example of Code
Inline Math (Part of a sentence)	\( … \)	In the equation \(3x + 5 = 11\), \(x\) is the variable.
Display Math (Centered, block format)	\[ … \]	Formula: \[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Unlike obsidian .md markdown files, you can't use '$' dollar signs for telling it when to do mathjax, Future Sean needs to remember to use the new delimiters
You can get it to use the new delimiters when you are adding a card by simply highlighting the text/formula -> then clicking the top right button that looks like an 'f(x)' 
Select the text you want to turn into a MathJax with the new delimiters and press : 'Ctrl' + 'M' + 'M' for inline and 'Ctrl' + 'M' + 'E' for block 
Or use the new addon you downloaded, also in the top right with the button looking like '\(...\)' and press that to replace the delimiters, or 'Alt' + 'M' hotkeys

Future Sean Problem :
Update my anki deck AI prompt query templates and remind the AI to use the new Delimiters when writing formulas with mathjax (creating anki decks for review)

Create a script to 'Find and Replace All'
Obsidian Input	Conversion Process	Anki CSV Output
Inline: The slope is $m$.	-> Find & Replace All ->	The slope is \(\text{m}\).
Block: Formula: $$y=mx+b$$	-> Find & Replace All	-> Formula: \[y=mx+b\]
