# TO DO : Create a script that creates anki decks/cards from my vocab lists - formats the first line of the kanji to be large and easily readable, 
# since anki uses html for formatting, this should be as easy as using inline CSS, or setting the card format beforehand,
# so the 'Kanji', 'Hiragana', and 'Romaji' on the front, 
# and puts the English meaning/definition text after the last '=' equals sign on the back of the cards
# some cards are missing the '=' inbetween the kanji=hiragana=romaji, so either I can get AI to reformat cards, 
# or make the script only check for the last '=' sign and put everything before it on the front and everything after it on the back
# also remember I added some lines that have 'Example = .....' that will need to be fixed
# my first set of misc vocab is almost at 1000 lines, I do NOT want to type that out manually creating each new anki card
