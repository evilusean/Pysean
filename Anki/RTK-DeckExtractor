Created a script to pull out all the data I will need to make Kanji Drop 
from the Remembering the Kanji Anki deck. - Heisig's RTK 6th Edition, Found at :
Remembering_the_Kanji_1_6th_Edition_2200_Kanji.apkg
Since '.apkg' files are similar to SQLite databases,
 I will extract the data from the database and save it to a JSON file.
I want future Sean to create another game that flashes the kanji on the screen briefly
 and then shows the answer after a brief delay, should be easy enough, and useful
 you should be able to select a range, 2200 kanji, learn 100-200, or 0-2200 for all,
 so if you want to learn 20 kanji a day, simply add your range of 1-20, 21-40, etc, etc, 
 and then to review all just add them all together like 1-200, for 10 days of review
