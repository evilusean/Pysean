8.8.8.8 = What it is: Google Public DNS primary resolver.
Purpose: One of the most widely used and reliable public DNS servers. You'll often see traffic to this IP if your system or router is configured to use Google's DNS services.
8.8.4.4 = 
What it is: Google Public DNS secondary resolver.
Purpose: The backup for 8.8.8.8. If the primary is unreachable, requests might fall back to this address.
1.1.1.1 = What it is: Cloudflare's Public DNS primary resolver.
Purpose: Another very popular and fast public DNS service, often chosen for privacy and speed.
1.0.0.1 = What it is: Cloudflare's Public DNS secondary resolver.
Purpose: The backup for 1.1.1.1.

192.168.1.1 = What it is: A very common default gateway (router) IP address.
Purpose: In many home and small office networks, this is the IP address assigned to the router, which acts as the central point for all traffic entering and leaving your local network. 
  Your devices will send traffic to this IP to reach the internet or other parts of your local network.
172.16.0.1 (or any IP in the 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 range) = 
What it is: The beginning of the 172.16.0.0/12 private IP address range. 172.16.0.1 itself might be used as a gateway or a specific device's IP.
Purpose: This range is commonly used in medium-sized networks (e.g., some corporate networks, larger home labs) where the 192.168.x.x range might be too small or conflicts with other subnets.
10.0.0.1 (or any IP in the 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 range) = 
What it is: The beginning of the 10.0.0.0/8 private IP address range. 10.0.0.1 itself is a common choice for a gateway or a specific device's IP.
Purpose: This is the largest of the private IP ranges and is frequently used in large corporate networks, data centers,
  and more complex home networks due to its vast number of available addresses.

Steam :
Steam utilizes many IP ranges and CDNs (Akamai, Valve's own networks, etc.) for game downloads, updates, and matchmaking.
Common Ports to Monitor (TCP/UDP):
27015-27050: Game traffic, updates, client communication.
4380: Voice chat, P2P networking.
3478, 4379: P2P networking.

Domains to Watch For:
steampowered.com
steamcommunity.com
steamcontent.com
steamstatic.com
akamaihd.net (a common CDN used by Steam and many others)

Example Wireshark Filter:
tcp.port >= 27015 and tcp.port <= 27050 or udp.port >= 27000 and udp.port <= 27100 (for game/client traffic)
dns.qry.name contains "steam"

Google (General Services) :
Google owns massive IP ranges globally. Aside from their public DNS, the IPs for services like Search, Gmail, Maps, etc., 
are constantly shifting and are delivered via their vast global infrastructure.

Common IPs (Public DNS):
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4
2001:4860:4860::8888 (IPv6)
2001:4860:4860::8844 (IPv6)

Domains to Watch For:
google.com
googleusercontent.com
gstatic.com
youtube.com (see YouTube section below)
gmail.com
googlevideo.com

Example Wireshark Filter:
http.host contains "google.com" or dns.qry.name contains "google.com"
ip.addr == 8.8.8.8 or ip.addr == 8.8.4.4 (for DNS traffic specifically)

4chan :
4chan is less complex than Google or Steam in terms of its underlying infrastructure, but its IPs can still change.

Domains to Watch For:
4cdn.org (for content delivery)
i.4cdn.org
s.4cdn.org
boards.4chan.org

Example Wireshark Filter:
http.host contains "4chan.org" or http.host contains "4cdn.org"
tcp.port == 80 or tcp.port == 443 (HTTP/HTTPS traffic)

GitHub :
GitHub also uses various CDNs and has a distributed infrastructure.

Common IPs for GitHub Pages (examples of static IPs for specific subdomains):
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
(And their IPv6 equivalents: 2606:50c0:8000::153, etc.)
Note: These are specifically for GitHub Pages. Core GitHub services will resolve to a wider range of IPs.

Domains to Watch For:
github.com
githubassets.com
github.io (for GitHub Pages)
raw.githubusercontent.com (for raw file access)

Example Wireshark Filter:
http.host contains "github.com" or http.host contains "github.io"
git (Wireshark has a git protocol dissector for Git-related traffic)

YouTube :
As a Google service, YouTube relies heavily on Google's global network and CDNs. IPs will be highly variable.

Domains to Watch For:
youtube.com
googlevideo.com (where video streams are often served from)
ytimg.com (for images and other static content)
youtube-nocookie.com

Example Wireshark Filter:
http.host contains "youtube.com" or http.host contains "googlevideo.com"
http.request.uri contains "videoplayback" (to find actual video stream requests)
quic (YouTube often uses QUIC, an experimental UDP-based protocol)

Blizzard (Hearthstone / Overwatch) :
Blizzard Entertainment, including Battle.net and games like Hearthstone and Overwatch, operates its own large network (ASN AS57976) and also uses CDNs.
You'll see connections to their core data centers and various regional servers.

Example IP Ranges (these are large blocks, not single IPs, and can change):
137.221.64.0/19
24.105.32.0/21
37.244.0.0/16 (a large portion of this range)
5.42.0.0/15 (another large portion)

Note: Filtering by these large ranges in Wireshark requires more specific filter syntax, like ip.addr in 137.221.64.0/19.

Common Ports (TCP/UDP, can vary by game):
1119 (Battle.net communication)
3724 (older game ports)
4000 (some game-related traffic)
6112 (some game-related traffic)
1120, 6881-6885 (P2P/Blizzard Downloader)

Many games use dynamic ports within a range, so monitoring a range might be necessary.

Domains to Watch For:
battle.net
blizzard.com
blz-contentstack.com

Example Wireshark Filter:
dns.qry.name contains "blizzard.com" or dns.qry.name contains "battle.net"
tcp.port == 1119 or udp.port == 1119
