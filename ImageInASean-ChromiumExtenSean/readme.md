I'm trying to create an extension to change from 'click tab' 'right click image' 'save as' 'enter' 'close tab' 'next tab' .....repeat x amount of times daily....  and instead change that to 'one click save all images' and keep all the posts open, but save the images in one click so I can save hours, but keep collecting my memes, I am but a humble meme farmer, tending to my own gardens something something voltaire
