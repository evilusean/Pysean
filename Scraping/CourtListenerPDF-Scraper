# TO DO: Find a way to scrape all the pdf documents for posterity - I am aware internet archive exists, but things have gone missing before.
# It's crazy how we live in a total panopticon surviellance society but anything related to '"them"' always goes missing, inconvenient truths = malinformation? misinformation? disinformation?
# here is what I wanted to scrape : https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66683865/government-of-the-united-states-virgin-islands-v-jpmorgan-chase-bank-na/?page=2
# unfortunately, I don't have time to go through hundreds of PDF's, but future Sean might want them, I am currently working on Step 1) escape canada, while being Starve-A-Sean'ed, Again.
# just thought of a funny joke, PDF file = P_D_ file, lol, lmao
# some anon already combined all the PDFiles, and uploaded them, so I don't need to click thousands of times : https://mega.nz/folder/A64ymBqI#dTuOhKdBgFdheja4it0OyA
# There's so much meat here, JPM and ukrainian girls, many names, we already have the black book, I personally, don't have time to go through thousands of PDFiles
# A good alternative would be getting OCR to read the PDFiles, and feed it to an AI somehow, and get a written summary of all the names and source documents - Future Sean problem.
