sudo pacman -S newsboat
Create a ~/.newsboat/urls file (by hand, in any text editor), and add the RSS feed addresses for the sites you want to track inside of it, and hit save.
  Now, when you run newsboat in a terminal emulator itâ€™ll track the links you added.
newsboat #RSS feed for news, will add some websites

Play Videos(Ascii) in Terminal -  this is actually pretty cool - converts it to ascii :
mpv --no-config --vo=tct /home/ArchSean/Downloads/LearnSlovakWhileYouSleep8Hours.mp4
mpv --vo=drm file.mp4
Just use ffmpeg and output to acscii in the console. #future sean project, take in a youtube url and convert it to an ascii video to play in terminal
