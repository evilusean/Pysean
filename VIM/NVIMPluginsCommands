NVim Tree :
Official Docs:
https://docs.rockylinux.org/books/nvchad/nvchad_ui/nvimtree/
Ctrl + N = Open the tree (shows directories)
Switch from the explorer window to the editor window and vice versa with the combinations 'Ctrl + h' to move left and 'Ctrl + l' to move right.
'H' = Shows hidden folders 
'E' = Expands All
'm' = Marks a file (for reuse later)
R = (refresh) to perform a reread of the files contained in the project
H = (hide) to hide/display hidden files and folders (beginning with a dot .)
E = (expand_all) to expand the entire file tree starting from the root folder (workspace)
W = (collapse_all) to close all open folders starting from the root folder
- = (dir_up) allows you to go back up folders. This navigation also allows you to exit the root folder (workspace) to your home directory
s = (system) to open the file with the system application set by default for that file type
f = (find) to open the interactive file search to which search filters can be applied
F = to close the interactive search
Ctrl + k = to display information about the file such as size, creation date, etc.
g + ? = to open the help with all the predefined shortcuts for quick reference
q = to close the file explorer
Opening a File:
Enter or o = to open the file in a new buffer and place the cursor on the first line of the file
Tab = to open the file in a new buffer while keeping the cursor in nvimtree, this for example is useful if you want to open several files at once
Ctrl + t = to open the file in a new tab that can be managed separately from the other buffers present
Ctrl + v = to open the file in the buffer by dividing it vertically into two parts, if there was already an open file this will be displayed side by side with the new file
Ctrl + h = to open the file like the command described above but dividing the buffer horizontally
File Management:
a (add) = allows the creation of files or folders, creating a folder is done by following the name with the slash /. E.g. /nvchad/nvimtree.md will create the related markdown file while /nvchad/nvimtree/ will create the nvimtree folder. 
  The creation will occur by default at the location where the cursor is in the file explorer at that time, so the selection of the folder where to create the file will have to be done previously or alternatively 
  you can write the full path in the statusline, in writing the path you can make use of the auto-complete function
r (rename) = to rename the selected file from the original name
Ctrl + r = to rename the file regardless of its original name
d (delete) = to delete the selected file or in case of a folder delete the folder with all its contents
x (cut) = to cut and copy the selection to the clipboard, can be files or folders with all its contents, with this command associated with the paste command you make the file moves within the tree
c (copy) = like the previous command this copies the file to the clipboard but keeps the original file in its location
p (paste) = to paste the contents of the clipboard to the current location
y = to copy only the file name to the clipboard, there are also two variants which are Y to copy the relative path and 'g + y' to copy the absolute path

Telescope (allows you to search for files in your project, ensure you are in directory before starting this) : 
<space> + f + f = Find Files Menu: will allow you to search for files in your current project folder
<space> + f + b = will search files already opened(in tabs) Find Open Files in buffers / tab to go forward / shift + tab to go backwards / close : <space> + x

Tabbufline (NVChad Tab Buffer Bars) :
<Tab> = Cycle through tabs
<Shift> + <Tab> = Cycle Backwards
<space> + x = close a tab
