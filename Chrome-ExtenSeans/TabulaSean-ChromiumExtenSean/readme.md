# TabulaSean - Chromium Tab Export/Import Extension

## What is TabulaSean?
TabulaSean is a privacy-friendly Chromium extension that lets you save all open tabs (across all windows) to a timestamped text file, and restore them laterâ€”even on another device. Great for backup, migration, or sharing your browsing session.

## Features
- Save all open tabs from all windows, grouped and labeled (e.g., "Window 1")
- Export tabs to a text file in `[Tab title, URL]` format, one tab per line, with empty lines between windows
- Filename includes timestamp: `yyyy-mm-dd-HHMMSS.txt`
- Import feature: restore tabs and windows from a saved file
- Works on Linux, Mac, and any Chromium-based browser
- No Google account or cloud required

2. Open Chromium/Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `TabulaSean-ChromiumExtenSean` folder.
5. The TabulaSean icon will appear in your browser toolbar.

## Usage
