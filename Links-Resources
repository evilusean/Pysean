Future Sean Problem/Project = Build an ASCII GUI that can view a browser/desktop/whatever, take a picture, convert to ascii, and then display in terminal - video to ASCII 

I want a way to transfer my current opened tabs from chromium on my arch linux machine and email them to my apple laptop so I can play them in the background,
  is there a way to save them as a CSV with this format 'youtube_video_title, youtube_URL' - best way is either a python script or chromium extension

Build a way to beat the ATS, create a python script that will take the job description, and all the buzzwords, add them to 0-1 point white font at the bottom of resume
  I have to rewrite my resume anyways, might as well do it right - play stupid games, win stupid prizes - Mine their job description and that pRedditor post for their magic special words

OCR - create an OCR that can read book titles on a shelf - I don't want to type out 100's of lines manually - my books aren't coming with me when I Step 1) Escape canada

OpenCV - Create another OpenCV project for a security system, doesn't have to be phenomenal, when I escape canada, I can finally afford to build cool stuff, 
  I want to have a security camera set up with facial id + tracking + timestamps + notificASeans - just get it working, I haven't built an OpenCV Project yet
  I'm paranoid enough to not want a third party app have access to me walking around in my gitch - gitching the matrix - basically I don't want it phoning home, so I build my own
  Will probably need a frontend/backend streaming(websockets? idk) - eventually want it to scale multiple cameras with commands that can be sent to a smart(ish) house to interact 
  can add more functionality like save last 24 hours - and then clip parts of it for future sean - or rewind, or whatever - how to store? idk, future sean problem 

OpenCV - Create a bot for whatever, been using the same hearthstone bot for years, could upgrade it to git gud and not just randomly throw down cards
