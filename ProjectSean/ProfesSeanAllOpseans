In Case I can't do web development in Japan, need to start thinking of alternative routes to escaping canada - 
OpSean 1) Teaching English - Already have TEFL, did it for 3ish years, once in Japan alot easier to get a Web Developer Job - one more year of suck for reaching the end goal - pay is garbage and they need a degREEEEEE for some reason
OpSean 2) Merchant Marine - Find a school or be a deckhand - 4-6 months on sea and I will have enough money saved up to go to a Japanese language school for a year - will also have internet and can maintain daily uploads
OpSean 3) Oil Rig/Minig Camp - 4-6 hard months = Enough saved up for Language School, hard labor, long days, big pay, not much else to say
OpSean 4) Family Loan - Tried this, no one wanted to help me, so I will return the favor, DiscriminASean -Enjoy your indians-so called f(r)iends and family are sooner to steal from you than they are to help you- it's ok when '"we"' do it
OpSean 5) CDL - Get a CDL License from either a driving school + govt loan(yuck) or presign a contract for a company that would pay for eduKSean(10kish) to drive a truck and in return get a year in contract - CDL opens OpSeans
  -could then save for and buy a doolie 2.5 ton -InnaWoods properly-main problem here is I would still be in '"the west"' and surrounded by brainwashed western idiots whom can't even do grade 5 math, or read, hazard to thEMselves and mME
  while being discrimated for jobs/school/hiring/loans and then screamed at '"WE R INCLUSIVE"' - There's a reason why I'm leaving '"the west"' - Not even allowed to say '"whos"' doing it - '"free and democratic"' - Lol, Lmao.
OpSsean 6) Logging - Go InnaWoods and escape the normie vaxcattle horde, be ahead of the herd, but my last 3 years of 'learning to code' would of been almost a total waste - 200k Minimum to buy enough land to even get started + dividends
