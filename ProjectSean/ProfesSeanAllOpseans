In Case I can't do web development in Japan, need to start thinking of alternative routes to escaping canada - 
OpSean 1) Teaching English - Already have TEFL, did it for 3ish years, once in Japan alot easier to get a Web Developer Job - one more year of suck for reaching the end goal - pay is garbage and they need a degREEEEEE for some reason
  Maybe degREEEEE isn't neccesary, this was one of the main reasons I chose china previously instead of Japan - I wanted to escape canada 10 years ago, before it was cool - It was intolerable then, it's worse now - 
  Would need to talk to old school/references - and rewrite Resume/CV/Cover letter - explaining my situation - do 1 year teaching, then I can do teching - Web Dev + Learn Japanese - will attempt at start of next month, saving resources:

OpSean 2) Merchant Marine - Find a school or be a deckhand - 4-6 months on sea and I will have enough money saved up to go to a Japanese language school for a year - will also have internet and can maintain daily uploads
  From what I've read one of the only jobs you can get on a ship is -Deckhand- Everything else requires going to school for 'Merchant Marine' - see

*NO* OpSean 5) CDL - Get a CDL License from either a driving school + govt loan(yuck) or presign a contract for a company that would pay for eduKSean(10kish) to drive a truck and in return get a year in contract - CDL opens OpSeans
  -could then save for and buy a doolie 2.5 ton -InnaWoods properly-main problem here is I would still be in '"the west"' and surrounded by brainwashed western idiots whom can't even do grade 5 math, or read, hazard to thEMselves and ME
  while being discrimated for jobs/school/hiring/loans and then screamed at '"WE R INCLUSIVE"' - There's a reason why I'm leaving '"the west"' - Not even allowed to say '"whos"' doing it - '"free and democratic"' - Lol, Lmao.
  5) https://ttcc.ca/transport-training/fredericton-campus/
  After Reading Some Forum Posts - even trucking is infested with jeets - 700$ a week for 60 hours a week - with 10k costs for school - Absolute garbage RoI : https://www.reddit.com/r/Truckers/comments/prchw1/trucking_school_in_canada/

  Jeets can just walk in and get a CDL - I need a class 5 (takes 2+ years of exp) -It's the double standards - They Get funded by my taxes for work placement programs - It's Offensive. I can't get a job and they are getting gibs.
  Hostile foreign OccupaySean - Less rights in '"our countries"' than foreigners -  Don't be mad at them, they can leave, be mad at '"the ones"' who brought them in to prop up their ponzi scheme - Green line go up! Traitors b4 nME's
OpSean 6) Logging - Go InnaWoods and escape the normie vaxcattle horde, be ahead of the herd, but my last 3 years of 'learning to code' would of been almost a total waste - 200k Minimum to buy enough land to even get started + dividends
OpSean 7) Go back to School for Electrical Engineering - I like electronics, and would actually enjoy this as a career - After COVID - still require Vax (Lol, Lmao) - So Called '"Higher EduKSean"' - kinda demoralIzeASean
  I can learn everything on my own, but normies/Jboomers need muh special piece of paper and refuse to train/hire because I don't have a black vag - my grievances aren't sean as legitimate because the majority are brainwashed cattle
OpSean 8) Web Developer in Japan - We don't Settle - Keep building/Applying - Fall down 7 times, get up 8 - Nana korobi ya oki - I am a strong independant man, and I know my worth! Future Glory - never again will the herd Aeffect me
  You guys want to enact insane laws and brainwash and experiment on kids? - Cool, have fun with that - I'm going to live and work around the people who don't do that - Certainly not bringing another child into this world to be abused
    You want me to pay half my income in taxes(+inflateSean) to be abused by idiots, tyrants, and idiotic tyrants - No, thanks, I'm good. - I'm gonna go hang around the people who don't do that - Good bye, and good riddance. 
OpSean 9) WWOOF(Worldwide Opportunites on Organic Farms) Cursory Research - Pay is trash, at least it gets me out of this failed state rent seeking parasite infested failed state of canada:

Welding/Carpentry/Lumber/Mine/Oil/ElectricSean - work enough to get a fat stack and escape canada(failed state - get out before the shooting starts) to go to a language school in either Slovakia/Japan
  also get skills that I can use for my own house in a country where it's actually feasible to own a house(own nothing, be sad, thanks jboomers-you earned that pensean)
  you want 40 years of labor for a sh!tshack made of cardboard with 9 roommates? - Lol, Lmao - Step 1) Escape. - Watch it burn from a safe distance  
Canada LocASeans - West Coast (too expensive, glad to see(sean?) that I can't even afford to live in '"our"' nicest province - Thanks, jboomers) - NS (Halifax) - Quebec(coast) - NB(border/coast) - PEI 
Until reparASeans and remunerASeans are made, you are all so deeply negative, I don't see how you're ever climbing out of that hole, after covid? Decades stolen because you idiots lied to me
Glad to see that immiGreatSeans get free money from taxes(Lol, Lmao) to subsidize their wages, as well as unlimited gibs, preference in hiring, eduKsean, employment, loans, don't forget to pay taxes(Lol, Lmao).  
Hanlons Razor - Is it malice or ignorance? How did it get this bad? They can't really be that stupid, can they? *After covid* Yes, Yes they can. 
It will never cease to amaze me that jboomers could take a country with 100's of years of positive momentum, dam near unlimited resources and landmass, and make it unlivable. Impressive. Very Nice. 
Show up to a shop, firm handshake, bootstraps, get a local job, save 40k, escape failed state of canada before it fails, watch from a safe distance. Lol, Lmao. 
just search 'all _ shops in _' and go firmhandshake them until they give me a job, don't mention anything about how I feel about canada, or canadians, or taxes, or ponzi schemes, pretend to be normal, for Step 1) Escape
Cold call local businesses - electricians, plumbers, whatever you're interested in. Tell them you're willing and committed to learn, you're clean, you can follow instructions, 
  and if needed, convey that you're honest, trustable, and a hard worker. Also, you prefer to pick up a broom rather than stand around when idle. Then do these things.

Temp Agency - Pain is temporary, escaping canada, and canadians, is eternal. 
Copy/paste the resume description in size 2 white font somewhere on your resume, cheap algos will flag you as extremely qualified since you have exactly the words of the job description on your resume

School for Electrical Engineering(still not allowed to go - vaxcattle Vs two more weeks? Vs Tumor weeks - gallows humour - if you're so smart why are you all taking mystery $cience juice because the tv told you?)
Two more weeks to flatten the curve - Tumor weaks, to flatten the herd - Midwit massacre - I still haven't received one apology - Ever. No Refunds. I still have never regretted not taking it, not once. 

ElectricSean/Carpentry/Welder + Japan :
Get 2 birds stoned? - Work constructSean in Japan, then apply for tech when I get there, 280k yen(vs 400k yen for tech) - pay isn't bad, better than teaching english - Step 1) Escape:
I would be an apprentice, not certified, would they still hire? only have 1 year plumbing experience, learning Japanese carpentry would be Kino, ElectricSean would be useful for future Sean

Datacenter Jobs - don't require a compsci degREEEEE 
DevOps - this is the current plan - need Docker/Go/AWS/Redis - before I can apply
Apply to companies - linkedin - over 500 applicASeans - only 4 responses, 2 offers (one for less than 20k teaching english, other needed drivers license) less than 1% call back, demoralIzeASean 
  - go to the source, email companies directly, my portfolio is almost at the fourth year mark, with dozens of projects, and I'm learning the Slovak language, I'd hire me. RepatriateSean.

Automations/Systems Control = automation/controls engineer job. There are entry level jobs you can get (even in Germany, I do lots of work in Germany, France, Italy, etc.).
  It sounds like you already know software, so it will be easy for you to learn PLC programming. Hit up a course on udemy stat. Also, you'll need electrical engineering basics. 
  Most of our controls guys have EE degrees, but you don't need the degree. Target big manufacturers. This is a very secure line of work, it's not going anywhere. 
  As long as you are okay traveling you can make bank. Feel free to ask me any other questions. I'm not a controls guy but I work directly with them.

Oil Rigs/Mining = Bust A$$ for 4-6 months, get a fat stack, escape canada

LumberSean - buy >10 acres of land (prohibitively expensive in failed state of rent seeking parasite infested canada) Await the collapse of canada deep innawoods, get used to deprivaSeans - It's not going to get better. DeluSeans.
  Would you rather hold appropriately named '"loonies"' that are printed by '"them"' to buy up real assets, or own land/housing? debt based fiat money - what a scam - 
  find a quick running spring on a mountain/elevated - use it to build head pressure in a pipe - use that head pressure to run a generator - get starlink - unironically code4food - would? wood. 
  or, harvest trees/deadfall on my land, sell to the monopoly of the irvings*ptuh* because there is no choice in this east coast fiefdom in our '"free democratic western nay-seans"' - I pay taxes so irvings can buy yet another house
  is that unstamped lumber you used to build your shack in the woods? that's illegal - bro, I can't even build a cabin to escape the vax/taxcattle - you must be hooked up to the grid and paying taxes to '"them"'. '"Captured country"' 
  also use to build a comfy cabin and escape the normie conformies before the collapse, I can't wait to not be around when the >50% dependant on a bankrupt government/pensions figure it out
  why would I work if I will never own a home? since '"they"' took away my god given right to go F off into the woods, yes, unironically, you do owe me a home. social CONtrACT - you stole decades from me, I want it back, with interest
  after covid, you are all DEEPly negative, It's not just the fact that jboomers put us all into unpayable debts and sold out our birthright for paper and '"promises"' - we now have to exist within those systems - No Escape.
  not wanting to be a slave is considered 'lazy' and 'entitled' - jboomers, who could buy a house, are getting a pension, offshored the industry, then imported millions for what few remained, call others '"entitled"'. Lol, Lmao
  they literally call unfunded liabilities 'entitlements' Lol, Lmao -

USAnnexes canada (we are already a vassal state) - Work in the US for 4x the salary, save a fat stack, go to Asia/Eastern Europe with saved up cash, work remote, live on less than 1000$ USD a month 
  This honestly is what I'm hoping for ATM, why would anyone fight for canada in it's current incarnASean - High taxes, unaffordable COL, 86% brainwashed non-sentient NPC's led around by the TV for decades.
  The people who abused you and stole half your income for decades while brainwashing/poisoning your f(r)iends while gaslighting you for pointing it out - now want to be on 'Team canada' Lol, Lmao. No. 
  Yea, '"those people"' want you to fight and suffer to maintain their artificial monopoly status and captured marketshare to maintain their current fiefdoms on their economic zones Vs Lol, Lmao. 
  I'd rather be an american wagie, than a canadian slave. At least in theory(not practice) we'd have free speech, a luxury we currently do not. The canadian loonie peso is worse than toilet paper. Sold our gold.
  We don't even have interprovincial free trade(look it up) - we have centralized monopolies that are state enforced for literally everything, milk, phones, etc. '"free democratic west"' rent seeking parasites. 
  '"our countries"' sold me out decades ago, I have received decades of abuse, and not one apology. Living in a southern state that isn't frozen 6 months of the year = Step 1) Escape. 
My only issue is that with over a century of centralizeASean - we should be decentralizing, and deglobalizing, but at this point, after decades of suffering. I don't care, get me out of canada and away from canadians.
Tell the rest of the world to clean up their own mess for once and change from pax americanna to fortress Americanna - until we fix our own nations, we shouldn't be nation building(after destroying) for '"others"'
Do you think jboomers are ashamed to any degree over leaving a world so horrible that the next generations don’t even want to maintain it to any degree and are hoping it all fails?
I love how they are attempting to appeal2nationalism through ice sportsball after decades of postnationalism propaganda and millions of new canadians who get wages subsidized while I get discriminASean. 

I spent 4 years 'learning to code', I now have to '"compete"' with people willing to work for slave wages, and apparently work-life-balance is too high according to eric schmidt from google :
https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1etnjat/former_google_ceo_eric_schmidts_stanford_talk/
I picked the wrong career, 4 years of work, and it was a total waste of time, the market is saturated with people who can live on 500$ a month, and can get fake degrees, and have no moral qualms about doing so.

pejoRATiveS are fleeing into a sinking ship. The only people dumb enough to want to come and prop up the canadian ponzi scheme are.. average IQ of 76 (Lol, Lmao.) - top 0.1%? or Reversion to mean. Race to the bottom.
Enjoy your low trust garbage society, don't be mad at me, this is the future you chose. jboomers and indians, you truly deserve eachother. The US is the best looking horse at the glue factory. I'm leaving. Good Luck.
I'm not building my game, forum, news aggregaSean site, or anything in canada, anything I build in canada makes it harder to leave. Step 1) Escape. 2) upgrade gear 3) create LLC 4) ??? 5) profit
canada is literally counter productive - because if you build anything here, then you have to deal with exit taxes, and the canadian govt (ptuh) - 50% of canadians are dependant on a bankrupt government (Lol, Lmao.)

Do Tech Sales, that's one thing they can't take over, every time I pick up the phone and hear an accent, instant hang up - they got the entire western world to stop answering their phones
Lol, Lmao "Call centres using AI to ‘whiten’ Indian accents" : https://www.yahoo.com/tech/call-centres-using-ai-whiten-090000847.html
Too late now, I still never answer my phone from an unknown number. - We are less free and taxed more now than medieval peasents - Pay infinite taxes, receive infinite indians - Compete with slavery, boyim. DIEversity. 
Bro, I just want a job, a house, a car, feed myself - Now I have to '"compete"' against billions of indians and AI - His optimism, gone. Smile, vanished. Unmoisturized, not in his lane, unhappy, owns nothing, sad.

IlluSean(of choice. GG.) - canada isn't real (I'd rather be homeless in america, than a taxpaying citizen(slave/taxcattle) of canada*ptuh*) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seMUsEb8fCI
  Bankrupt Britain (BB) - LBMA london gold 'fix' - Larouche was right about '"london bankers"' - We are being enslaved by words on paper, paper money. Lol, Lmao. - It's the current year, why do we still have a king? 'Crown Land'
  We pay half our income in taxes, on money they create from nothing, that charges interest(P<P+I), to support tyrants, R*'s, and tyrannical R*'s. A tyrant is useless without the wall of R*'s behind him beLIEving everything they say. 
Just when you think 'at least canada*ptuh* can't get any worse' Lol, Lmao. Yes, it can(ada). As an unvaccinated straight white male. If the tariffs make canada even more intolerable, can I claim refugee status? 
After decades of abuse and gaslighting, and not one of my grievances sean as legitimate. It's time for some remunera/ReparaSeans, I'll take those free debit cards, hotels, and money for food(starving, again). Ayo, where them gibs at? 
1/3 of economy on housing ponzi scheme, 1/3 of REEEEEEconomy on bloated bureaucratic failed state, 1/3 of economy on tariffed exports. Will this finally pop the housing bubble? Repeat after me : 'Housing is not a speculative investment'
The USA built the wrong wall, begin 'Operation Snowback'. What happened after the smoot-hawley tariffs? Oh 'The Great Depression' - that sounds fun, lets do that again, 'Make America Great Again' Lol, Lmao. 
"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, 
  the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered" - Jefferson, allegedly, 'own nothing'
expansion of credit led to the inflated land values before the great depression, huh, crazy, whaddaya know, the exact same thing with the '"usual suspects"', again. FDIC = 1933 = look into how much is in reserve to insure deposits <1%.
0% reserve requirement ratio - Lol, Lmao. Somehow, I'm the bad guy for not wanting to play in a rigged game, I don't want to play a game of monopoly where '"they"' are the bankers, exchanging my labor for paper. Fix the money/incentives
