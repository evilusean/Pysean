In Case I can't do web development in Japan, need to start thinking of alternative routes to escaping canada - 
OpSean 1) Teaching English - Already have TEFL, did it for 3ish years, once in Japan alot easier to get a Web Developer Job - one more year of suck for reaching the end goal - pay is garbage and they need a degREEEEEE for some reason
OpSean 2) Merchant Marine - Find a school or be a deckhand - 4-6 months on sea and I will have enough money saved up to go to a Japanese language school for a year - will also have internet and can maintain daily uploads
  From what I've read one of the only jobs you can get on a ship is -Deckhand- Everything else requires going to school for 'Merchant Marine' - see

OpSean 3) Oil Rig/Minig Camp - 4-6 hard months = Enough saved up for Language School, hard labor, long days, big pay, not much else to say
OpSean 4) Family Loan - Tried this, no one wanted to help me, so I will return the favor, DiscriminASean -Enjoy your indians-so called f(r)iends and family are sooner to steal from you than they are to help you- it's ok when '"we"' do it
*NO* OpSean 5) CDL - Get a CDL License from either a driving school + govt loan(yuck) or presign a contract for a company that would pay for eduKSean(10kish) to drive a truck and in return get a year in contract - CDL opens OpSeans
  -could then save for and buy a doolie 2.5 ton -InnaWoods properly-main problem here is I would still be in '"the west"' and surrounded by brainwashed western idiots whom can't even do grade 5 math, or read, hazard to thEMselves and ME
  while being discrimated for jobs/school/hiring/loans and then screamed at '"WE R INCLUSIVE"' - There's a reason why I'm leaving '"the west"' - Not even allowed to say '"whos"' doing it - '"free and democratic"' - Lol, Lmao.
  5) https://ttcc.ca/transport-training/fredericton-campus/
  After Reading Some Forum Posts - even trucking is infested with jeets - 700$ a week for 60 hours a week - with 10k costs for school - Absolute garbage RoI : https://www.reddit.com/r/Truckers/comments/prchw1/trucking_school_in_canada/
  You can't even take the course without a class 5, god I can't wait to escape this rentseeking parasite bureaucratic cesspit: https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/services/services_renderer.201491.Driver_s_Licences.html
  Jeets can just walk in and get a CDL - I need a class 5 (takes 2+ years of exp) -It's the double standards - They Get funded by my taxes for work placement programs - It's Offensive. I can't get a job and they are getting gibs.
  Hostile foreign OccupaySean - Less rights in '"our countries"' than foreigners -  Don't be mad at them, they can leave, be mad at '"the ones"' who brought them in to prop up their ponzi scheme - Green line go up! Traitors b4 nME's
OpSean 6) Logging - Go InnaWoods and escape the normie vaxcattle horde, be ahead of the herd, but my last 3 years of 'learning to code' would of been almost a total waste - 200k Minimum to buy enough land to even get started + dividends
OpSean 7) Go back to School for Electrical Engineering - I like electronics, and would actually enjoy this as a career - After COVID - still require Vax (Lol, Lmao) - So Called '"Higher EduKSean"' - kinda demoralIzeASean
  I can learn everything on my own, but normies/Jboomers need muh special piece of paper and refuse to train/hire because I don't have a black vag - my grievances aren't sean as legitimate because the majority are brainwashed cattle
OpSean 8) Web Developer in Japan - We don't Settle - Keep building/Applying - Fall down 7 times, get up 8 - Nana korobi ya oki - I am a strong independant man, and I know my worth! Future Glory - never again will the herd Aeffect me
  You guys want to enact insane laws and brainwash and experiment on kids? - Cool, have fun with that - I'm going to live and work around the people who don't do that - Certainly not bringing another child into this world to be abused
    You want me to pay half my income in taxes(+inflateSean) to be abused by idiots, tyrants, and idiotic tyrants - No, thanks, I'm good. - I'm gonna go hang around the people who don't do that - Good bye, and good riddance.
