A File to store all of my notes/TODO's/Links for escaping decadent failed state of canada:
13May2024: Finished Both Portfolios/Resume/CV made with LaTex(fanseanist resume I've ever sean), uploaded to linkedIn, copy in this repo
  Final Stage of Escape. After years of work. Countless hours, no days off in 2 years, I have finally got it all together and can escape these idiots forever
  Now instead of worrying about whatever the 'current thing' is and how the brainwashed idiots are going to respond, I just need to focus on saying 'I want the red one' (watashi wa hoshi akai ichi)
  In a few months I will be around people who are thin, can do grade 5 math, and aren't brainwashed by the TV for 40 years. Sipping strong zeros on a beach, wandering the safe, clean streets, with affordable houses. The Sean Dream.
  Finished Resume, added real name/address, going to start applying tommorrow full-time/tilt
  Applied to first job, adding all applied jobs to the google sheet 'ApplicASeans' in this repo with a link to their job posting+date contacted.
  Applied to 2 more jobs, opened a bunch of tabs for tommorrow from japan-dev, and easy applied to 5+ on linkedIn - didn't save any of those to the google sheet
  4 More ApplicaSeans - from Japan-dev

14May2024: Starting With creating a list of sites to check on a daily basis 
  Created an account on Amazon, filled out all info, going to Job Search there - they are full english - no Japanese needed - full sponsorship - Applied for first job
  Applied to 3 jobs on https://jobs.en-jp.teksystems.com/l/recruiting/jobapplicationsubmitted/243fd3f4-fd8e-11ee-8179-42010a8a0fd9/cd70872e-11a3-11ef-8dd7-42010a8a0fd9/false?&lastpage=last
  Easy Applied to 5 more on LinkedIn
  Do Amazon Tabs next (start with tokyo)

TODO: Add all projects to LinkedIn(theres like 10 missing - haven't updated in a year)
  Get phone # / Address / Real name and update, create a real version of resume so I don't get official docs(sho rui) messed up at border and have to wait an extra month because of naming convenseans
  Find a recruiter, send updated resuMe 
  Plug Phone Back in, clean your room, wash your p... basically get ready in case I get an impromptu interview, I look preSeantable. 
  Since my sleep schedule is weird - unplug at 'night' and plug back in when wake up -

Daily Schedule Till Hired/Recruiter - Fill out top to bottom (priority=top) and finish with LinkedIn Easy Apply - Escape. :
