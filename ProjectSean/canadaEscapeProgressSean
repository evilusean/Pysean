A File to store all of my notes/TODO's/Links for escaping decadent failed state of canada:
13May2024: Finished Both Portfolios/Resume/CV made with LaTex(fanseanist resume I've ever sean), uploaded to linkedIn, copy in this repo
  Final Stage of Escape. After years of work. Countless hours, no days off in 2 years, I have finally got it all together and can escape these idiots forever
  Now instead of worrying about whatever the 'current thing' is and how the brainwashed idiots are going to respond, I just need to focus on saying 'I want the red one' (watashi wa hoshi akai ichi)
  In a few months I will be around people who are thin, can do grade 5 math, and aren't brainwashed by the TV for 40 years. Sipping strong zeros on a beach, wandering the safe, clean streets, with affordable houses. The Sean Dream.
  Finished Resume, added real name/address, going to start applying tommorrow full-time/tilt
  Applied to first job, adding all applied jobs to the google sheet 'ApplicASeans' in this repo with a link to their job posting+date contacted.

20May2024: Applied to 5 Jobs on LinkedIn

21May2024: Applied to 5 more jobs on LinkedIn, 1 Interview, 2 contacts asking for ClarificaSean/Better Resume -  translated resume into Japanese(took hours to find new font/character set) Will need to double check the Japanese
  Used AI to write Japanese Resume because I suck at Kanji - Need to work on other longer resume with work experienced, some random recruiter told me to watch my 'tone'? and that my resume needed a native speaker to look over it

22May2024: Decided to do one LeetCode a day + work on 3 more NextJS projects for portfolio, taking my total from 6-9 on my Web Developer Portfolio, should show I have a solid grasp of NextJS + React = money/Escape
  spent all day looking at potential projects, settled on a NextJS KanBan Board - should take less than 4 days, maybe do an AI chatbot, or a Japanese large number generator/tester(actually need this), need 2 more new good projects
  all of my new projects MUST be hostable on vercel, I have 4 spaces left(on vercel-free tier) and most of my current stuff just links to github, 

23May2024: Fixing Resume, adding on Work Experience + EduKSean, making a resume that is longer than 1 page - then translating to Japanese
  Doing one Leetcode a day and going to start next project after fixing longer resume

24May2024: Created English version of ResuME, long form with work exp/eduKSean, now need to translate into Japanese, need to translate work experience/Header Titles + LocaSeans / EduKsean
  some kanji aren't translatable with the font/character set I'm using - so I need to go through the resume line by line and replace those with hiragana - Tedious - should be done today then starting applying again

25May2024: taking longer for TransLaSean than thought, spent all yesterday and got half of it done, need to go through line by line and translate each character that didn't format correctly and replace with hiragana, should be done soon
  then back to applying, still need to get it looked over by a native speaker, going to apply for Korea as well as Japan, and some based american states(there's like 3), and if I have time some Europe, anything is better than
  the decadent failed state dictatorship obedient oversocialized rent seeking parasite brainwashed normie tax/vax cattle unapologetically dumb petty tyrant infested frozen communist captured post nation sh!thole ponzi scheme of canada  
Going to add hiragana/Romaji version + English version in %comments% for my resume, I have no idea what half of this kanji means, still replacing the characters, tedious AF, AI generated, hopefully it's enough to Git A Job
  Finally finished long Japanese resume, took 2 days to add a single page, had to fix all the broken kanji characters and copy+paste hiragana in, because I don't have Japanese keyboard, now ready to get back to job hunt.

TODO: Add all projects to LinkedIn(theres like 10 missing - haven't updated in a year)
  Get phone # / Address / Real name and update, create a real version of resume so I don't get official docs(sho rui) messed up at border and have to wait an extra month because of naming convenseans
  Find a recruiter, send updated resuMe 
  Plug Phone Back in, clean your room, wash your p... basically get ready in case I get an impromptu interview, I look preSeantable. 
  Since my sleep schedule is weird - unplug at 'night' and plug back in when wake up -
  Create Second longer resume, with 'work experience' and 'eduksean' - was trying to keep original under one page. 'Customer Service' Talk about projects you built, if no reply from 'portfolios 1 page versuin'
    "I am willing to learn, I am willing to relocate, but am looking for the right opportunity"
  Create More Projects, want to build an AI chatbot, will either need to remove an old project, or add another 'row' of x3 projects to my Web Developer Portfolio, can deploy on vercel
    Also want to build, a NextJS banking app, (6 hours = 12 days), can deply on Vercel, we get 5 free projects, we have 1 currently, add 3 more, 
    So our 'Webdeveloper' portfolio will have x9  projects, x3 already using NextJS, and we are building x3 more and hosting on vercel = x4 hosted on vercel and x6 NextJS projects = will code for food
    x9 projects is less aesthetic, but I haven't sean one reply in 2 days + >50 applicASeans, so we need to build more, can learn the language when I get there, I need to - Escape. 
Worst case ontario - Teach English for a year, then move into tech - Worst worst case ontario - stuck in limbo/purgatory of canada, surrounded by these unapologetic brainwashed vaxcattle - forever and ever. This is hell.  
   - FUTURE SEAN NOTE: Started on 15 May, if no good leads/responses by 15June - Look into teaching English for a year - free flight / visa / housing for a year till I get situated, then can apply from inside Japan - better chances
  Day 3, over 50 applicASeans: havn't received any positive leads yet, might start thinking of other countries? ireland? scotland? south america? czech? hungary? romania? anywhere but the '"west"' two faced mindbroken vaxcattle
  Low/No Tax: Monaco / Malta / Malaysia / Ireland(based) / Cyprus / Swiss(å±±Js) / Georgia / Sark(pop=500) / Estonia / Poland / El Salvador / Argentina / Spain / Singapore / Korea / Spain / Georgia / Hungary / Czech
  Just Search LinkedIn if you have an extra 10 minutes, might get lucky - Sark / Ireland / Malta / Poland / Hungary(repatriaSean) would be based, It's only been 3 days - give it at least a month before thinking of other OpSeans -Escape.
  I want PR in Japan, buy a house in the mountains, and work remote, but if they aren't hiring unless I have a special piece of paper, what can be done? New LocaSean 
  'Based States' = Kentucy / Tennessee / Idaho / Florida? / Texas? / SD? / AZ? / CO? / Ireland / South Korea / Norway / Poland / Hungary

  Dye Blonde Hair + Sunglasses / claim asylum - get free phone/daily stipend/Squat on some PE/Jboomers fifth empty house for free property / Get free state housing/Hotel + monthly gibs + eduKsean. Don't forget to pay taxes. Lol, Lmao. 
  Max Stirner Would be proud, what is my property? 'my property is precisely the whole of my world to the extent that I can grasp it' - Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. = Perverse Incentives Vs Moral Hazard Kalergi vs Cloward Piven

Spiel (got tired of rewriting this every ApplicASean, just saving here, for now, If I am ambitious can make a python script with something like Hello, {company} I hear you are hiring for {position} with {variables}:
Hello, ããã«ã¡ã¯. I've been learning to code for 3 years, I'm mid and looking for a junior position. I'm currently living in canada, but looking to work, and live in Japan. 
While learning Japanese. I can communicate at a level above charades, but would not be comfortable doing a full technical interview in Japanese. I spent 4 months learning up to ~N3/N4 level, and went back to coding.
I have 2 portfolios, one for Python/Data Analyst and one for Web Development, they can be found at the bottom of this website. If you are interested, send me an email at any time. Here is a link to both portfolios,
thank you for your time and considerASean.
