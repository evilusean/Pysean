A File to store all of my notes/TODO's/Links for escaping decadent failed state of canada(where dreams go to die, jboomer haven):
13May2024: Finished Both Portfolios/Resume/CV made with LaTex(fanseanist resume I've ever sean), uploaded to linkedIn, copy in this repo
  Final Stage of Escape. After years of work. Countless hours, no days off in 2 years, I have finally got it all together and can escape these idiots forever
  Now instead of worrying about whatever the 'current thing' is and how the brainwashed idiots are going to respond, I just need to focus on saying 'I want the red one' (watashi wa hoshi akai ichi)
  In a few months I will be around people who are thin, can do grade 5 math, and aren't brainwashed by the TV for 40 years. Sipping strong zeros on a beach, wandering the safe, clean streets, with affordable houses.
  Finished Resume, added real name/address, going to start applying tommorrow full-time/tilt
  Applied to first job, adding all applied jobs to the google sheet 'ApplicASeans' in this repo with a link to their job posting+date contacted.

20May2024: Applied to 5 Jobs on LinkedIn

21May2024: Applied to 5 more jobs on LinkedIn, 1 Interview, 2 contacts asking for ClarificaSean/Better Resume -  translated resume into Japanese(took hours to find new font/character set) Will need to double check the Japanese
  Used AI to write Japanese Resume because I suck at Kanji - Need to work on other longer resume with work experienced, some random recruiter told me to watch my 'tone'? and that my resume needed a native speaker to look over it

22May2024: Decided to do one LeetCode a day + work on 3 more NextJS projects for portfolio, taking my total from 6-9 on my Web Developer Portfolio, should show I have a solid grasp of NextJS + React = money/Escape
  spent all day looking at potential projects, settled on a NextJS KanBan Board - should take less than 4 days, maybe do an AI chatbot, or a Japanese large number generator/tester(actually need this), need 2 more new good projects
  all of my new projects MUST be hostable on vercel, I have 4 spaces left(on vercel-free tier) and most of my current stuff just links to github, 

23May2024: Fixing Resume, adding on Work Experience + EduKSean, making a resume that is longer than 1 page - then translating to Japanese
  Doing one Leetcode a day and going to start next project after fixing longer resume

24May2024: Created English version of ResuME, long form with work exp/eduKSean, now need to translate into Japanese, need to translate work experience/Header Titles + LocaSeans / EduKsean
  some kanji aren't translatable with the font/character set I'm using - so I need to go through the resume line by line and replace those with hiragana - Tedious - should be done today then starting applying again

25May2024: taking longer for TransLaSean than thought, spent all yesterday and got half of it done, need to go through line by line and translate each character that didn't format correctly and replace with hiragana, should be done soon
  then back to applying, still need to get it looked over by a native speaker, going to apply for Korea as well as Japan, and some based american states(there's like 3), and if I have time some Europe, anything is better than
  the decadent failed state dictatorship obedient oversocialized rent seeking parasite brainwashed normie tax/vax cattle unapologetically dumb petty tyrant infested frozen communist captured post nation sh!thole ponzi scheme of canada  
Going to add hiragana/Romaji version + English version in %comments% for my resume, I have no idea what half of this kanji means, still replacing the characters, tedious AF, AI generated, hopefully it's enough to Git A Job
  Finally finished long Japanese resume, took 2 days to add a single page, had to fix all the broken kanji characters and copy+paste hiragana in, because I don't have Japanese keyboard, now ready to get back to job hunt.

Just realized that you can see my updates from my main github page, although canada is a prison work colony of sorts, I feel any onlookers that see my plans to become trans racial 'Le Seaniqua' as a new hire
  might dissuade some employers, although accurate, and true, none of these things matter to the normie mind (truth is no defence, if it causes offence-truth is illegal in a court of lawl in canada if it offends)
  They just want the appearance of normality, the banality of evil. DiscriminASean - except when '"we"' do it, for future Sean, moving to the much more family friendly version here:
  https://github.com/evilusean/Pysean/blob/main/ProjectSean/ApplicASeans

TODO: Add all projects to LinkedIn(theres like 10 missing - haven't updated in a year)
  Maybe I need to update/elaborate my Tech/IT Experience - 10 years experience for visa purposes - I built my first website when I was 13... so technically true...
  Maybe change email to firstname.lastname@gmail.com = more ProfessSeanal
  Update Wantedly / Daijob accounts with new info - should take all day
  Take Picture of Military graduASean, need better lighting, flash causes a reflecSean, looks terrible
  Find a recruiter, send updated resuMe 
  Need to create a cover letter, that takes inputs and spits out a generic - Hello, {company}, I am Sean, I have {skills} that would match, I have {x} years of experience in {language} which I saw mentioned on your {ad}
  Create More Projects, want to build an AI chatbot, will either need to remove an old project, or add another 'row' of x3 projects to my Web Developer Portfolio, can deploy on vercel
    Also want to build, a NextJS banking app, (6 hours = 12 days), can deply on Vercel, we get 5 free projects, we have 1 currently, add 3 more, 
    So our 'Webdeveloper' portfolio will have x9  projects, x3 already using NextJS, and we are building x3 more and hosting on vercel = x4 hosted on vercel and x6 NextJS projects = will code for food
    x9 projects is less aesthetic, but I haven't sean one reply in 2 days + >50 applicASeans, so we need to build more, can learn the language when I get there, I need to - Escape. 
Worst case ontario - Teach English for a year, then move into tech - Worst worst case ontario - stuck in limbo/purgatory of canada, surrounded by these unapologetic brainwashed vaxcattle - forever and ever. This is hell.  
   - FUTURE SEAN NOTE: Started on 15 May, if no good leads/responses by 15June - Look into teaching English for a year - free flight / visa / housing for a year till I get situated, then can apply from inside Japan - better chances
  Day 3, over 50 applicASeans: havn't received any positive leads yet, might start thinking of other countries? ireland? scotland? south america? czech? hungary? romania? anywhere but the '"west"' two faced mindbroken vaxcattle
  Low/No Tax: Monaco / Malta / Malaysia / Ireland(based) / Cyprus / Swiss(山Js) / Georgia / Sark(pop=500) / Estonia / Poland / El Salvador / Argentina / Spain / Singapore / Korea / Spain / Georgia / Hungary / Czech / Argentina?
  Just Search LinkedIn if you have an extra 10 minutes, might get lucky - Sark / Ireland / Malta / Poland / Hungary(repatriaSean) would be based, It's only been 3 days - give it at least a month before thinking of other OpSeans -Escape.
  I want PR in Japan, buy a house in the mountains, and work remote, but if they aren't hiring unless I have a special piece of paper, what can be done? New LocaSean 
Find Interview questions on glassdoor, create a reference link, and add questions, prepare, amazon+japan = kino, great start to career :
  https://www.glassdoor.ca/Interview/Amazon-Interview-Questions-E6036.htm
Foreigners get treated better in '"our"' countries than we do? Modern problems require modern soluseans - Fly to Mexico - All money on debit card - can't get robbed - 'Lose'/mail DocumentASean - No hablos englais + No nintendo / 
  Dye Blonde Hair + Sunglasses / claim asylum - get free phone/daily stipend/Squat on some PE/Jboomers fifth empty house for free property / Get free state housing/Hotel + monthly gibs + eduKsean. Don't forget to pay taxes. Lol, Lmao. 
  Max Stirner Would be proud, what is my property? 'my property is precisely the whole of my world to the extent that I can grasp it' - Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. = Perverse Incentives Vs Moral Hazard Kalergi vs Cloward Piven
Cut All Ties, No Storage, No Cards, No Licenses, No Properties, No Wife, Sinking Ship, Failed State. Let it burn, watch from a safe distance @ 6:00 :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYW23RPL4fU&ab_channel=Tuomas 
Work in US for a year -> buy some land -> build some storage/shipping container -> go to canada, rent truck, move stuff to land -> Have excess savings -> Go To Japanese Language School -> Apply When in Japan -> Escape.
Hail Mary = change race from 'white/prefer not to disclose' to 'hispanic/latino'(tan) and watch the offers roll in,  if asked if I speak Spanish to just say "No, I did as a child but lost it over time because of lack of use"
  The system(that we pay for. Lol, Lmao) is built for discriminASean. Tax Breaks/Contracts are given out based on skin color(very definisean of racism) - but it's ok when '"we"' do it - preferential hiring/loan/eduKsean treatment.
  Those whom are honest in a dishonest world, will be destroyed. Those whom are good will be destroyed by the great many whom are not good. Do you really think the millions of new canadians are being honest on their resumes? Lol, Lmao
  Social Experiment : Over >1000 ApplicaSeans, 2 Interviews = 0.002% . Fill out forms as a 'Disabled Autistic, Gay Trans LatinX' in America, Play Stupid Games Win Stupid Prizes - DiversificASean TransFormASean for BlackRock Buckz - 
  If anyone questions me, I identify as Xir, don't be a bigot, etc etc - Gynocracy went so hard it returned to patriarchy - They realized it was easier to convince autistic men they are women than to make women good at tech - Lol, Lmao
  Forced to pay half my income in taxes to a society that discriminates against me based on my immutable charasteristics while screaming at me '"WE R INCLUSIVE"' - the hypocrisy is glaring - With no ability to escape, read sun tzu foo
  Provoke a ReactSean - InstigateSean 2 AxSean - They want you to react to the obvious inJustUs's - Literally decades of abuse - 1 response = '"SEE? LOOK! HOW HE ACTS! WE WERE RIGHT TO ABUSE HIM FOR DECADES"' - Low Time Preference - 
  The System is built to fail (P < P + I) all you have to do is sit back and watch from a safe distance, we can rebuild and then hold those responsible, accountable, they have an infinite money glitch - Work hard? InflateSean Waste NRG
  Don't work? Starve - Leave the system and go off grid? Men with guns will come and grab you- There is no victory here, Only winning move is not to play- Watch how when the paychecks dry up how they turn on eachother- ReverSean 2 Mean 
Social Experiment - Set up a second linkedin account with new CV/no projects or github with a black name 'LeSeanDa P. Johnson' - get my social justice DEI brownie points, have the exact same resume
  see how many call backs I get by just changing my name, reverse discriminASean - It's ok when '"we"' do it - You are paying taxes, so the governments can afford to make laws that are explicit discriminASean against you
https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/just-6-percent-of-new-sp-jobs-went-to-white-applicants-in-the-wake-of-george-floyd-analysis-shows/
You are paying taxes so you can subsidize the salary of indians, and prop up the canadian jboomer housing ponzi scheme. Step 1) Escape canada (I am NOT cleaning up that mess - decades of abuse and theft, not one apology) -
'The government doesn't spend like a drunken sailor, the drunken sailor spends his own money' - government debt allows the to shackle future generASeans in unpayable odious debts, it's automatically deducted, you don't have a choice
Shipping Industry-can do daily github uploads/Oil/Mining/Camp Work(no uploads) - Work ass off for 6 months, take cash earned for language school, 40k saved = 1 year of school+housing + Escape.
Deckhand/Merchant Marine - Ship out of halifax, land in Japan, would still need a visa though. I can make 40-50k if I do <6 months, enough to escape, and can still do daily uploads on github.

I view coding almost as a tertiary skill similar to reading, it's just something you should know how to do, was anyone hiring a 'Professional Reader?' (Literature degreeeeees?) - I got kicked from uni for not being a vaxcattle
  booted from UNB for being TOO smart. I am now taking written apologies, with remunera/reparASeans and scholarships enclosed. I still haven't received a single apology or mea culpa. I am clearly smarter than 86% of you vaxmaxxers, 
  because I don't poison myself or my kids with mystery $cience juice when the TV tells me to. If anyone deserves to go to school and get a degREEEEE for FREEEE, it should be MEEEEE. We Will  SEEEEan. SEEEEEthe EEEEEternaLLYYYY vaxIEEEESSS.
  Ironically, they are still using a piece of paper as a metric of intelligence(Lol, Lmao), so I can't even teach English without it, and I have too much morality to lie about it, or scam welfare(definitely not WINdianING).
  During covid, they kicked out all of the smart and moral people from every institution, that should concern you. The '"ship"' is being run, and maintained by immoral profligate brainwashed REE_s incapable of independant thought.
  CompetentSean crisis Vs Complex Systems Vs Cascade Failure - Thankfully, the only thing I need to do to escape failed state of canada is to learn a second language, it's easier for me to learn a new language than it is to fix canada.
  I don't view the corporation of canada as legitimate, and I don't care which puppet they put up in ottawa, we just have to pretend that whoever is (s)elected is legitmate so you don't spook the cattle.
  Voting/Taxes legitimizes a broken system, no TaxASean without RepresentASean, not a single *expletive* in ottawa represents me, decades of abuse and theft, not one apology. Wait until the cops figure out they aren't getting their pension.
  Learn to code they said, '"compete"' with billions of indains and AI they said, it will pay well they said, Lol, Lmao, I said. Just pay half your income in taxes on money created from nothing at interest for 40 years then you die. Lol, Lmao.
  Until work affords me the ability to buy a house and a truck, I could care less what happens to '"the system"' or those who depend on it, I will be spending all of my efforts escaping to a country where 40 hours of labor gets me a house/truck.
  'The bar' is at rock bottom, and you can't even meet that, the people who depend on the blood of the young and unborn for their '"entitlements"' call others entitled. Lol, Lmao. I just don't want to be a debt slave to '"expletives"'. 
  Mad max scenario, to me, would actually be a net gain, because people wouldn't be stealing half my income + inflation, to tell me what I can and can't do, say, put in my body, etc, etc. You are so bad, a total collapse would be prefereable to
  '"expletive"' tyranny. That's how bad you are. No '"expletives"' in Asia. - If they stole half my income and f'd off, that would be better, but they don't, they take half of your income and use it to enslave/abuse you and everyone else.

canada locaSeans(still stuck in '"canada"' if stuck I want property by the Sea(n)) - Step 1) escape. hopefully the millions of indians '"they"' imported will enjoy paying half their income in taxes, as I have, 
  just remembered, '"we"' subsidize the wages of indians, I can't afford to eat, rent, or escape, and they get wage subsidies and preference in hiring/education/loans. Don't forget to vote, pay taxes - you get the 
  '"hu-white"' privilege is to pay half your income in taxes, to then be abused by people whom are objectively dumb(vaxcattle) so they can afford to think up new creative ways to abuse and replace you - '"canada"' :

Slovakia -> South Korea -> Spain -> Thailand -> Phillipines -> Poland -> Romania -> Georgia -> Russia -> Mexico -> Argentina -> Vietnam -> Malaysia -> (or spend 5 minutes in photoshop, too bad I have morality)
Try to get a tech job - Then look at teaching jobs - Start with below for tech, then go with above for teaching - Step 1) Escape. :

Spiel (got tired of rewriting this every ApplicASean, just saving here, for now, If I am ambitious can make a python script with something like Hello, {company} I hear you are hiring for {position} with {variables}:
Hello, こんにちは. I've been learning to code for 3 years, I'm mid and looking for a junior position. I'm currently living in canada, but looking to work, and live in Japan.
