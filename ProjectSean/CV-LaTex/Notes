    !FUTURE SEAN! If you are creating another CV/updating, take the files from here after downloading the repo: https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV
    !Then replace those example files with the personal edited ones - it should allow you to create the fanseanist CV
    !Also note: Used Dummy Data for Name/Address/LocaSean - will need to replace that first.

    Resume Template - fill in the blanks with AI - add all skills(alot) - courses - brief job summary, one sentence per -
    get AI to help write resume - will need to find old one, it's in old email somewhere, update it with all the buzzwords
        get the dates, add DescriptSeans from AI, hit all the ATS bingo words, then toss to a recruiter
    find a recruiter - we are already a month behind schedule, was supposed to be applying April 01, need to - Escape.
        they will do the heavy lifting for me and also the higher my salary, the more they get paid -

    Resume Work:
    Formatting = Simple Text / Format - If AI can't read, won't be sean
    Be brief about old job experience - one seantence each
    create a courses completed list, and a skills list, place up front.
    try to keep it to one page, if accidently overshoot, use the 'empty space' and fill it in with 1 size white text font with ALL the buzzwords
    if feeling ambitious customize the resume for the job, read their buzzwords and insert them into your resume - we have a recruiter to sell us
    Add all old DoD courses to new course list - found them on my old resume, do I need to add the volunteer work I did 10 years ago?
    What about TEFL? What if I used my course list instead of work experience? I forget the dates for that, I think I have the cert somewhere around
    Do they really give a F if I worked in grocery/landscaping/plumbing? I don't - If I need space - this is the first thing that can go
    I don't technically have any relevant work experience, the first job is the hardest, the resume I found was OLD - like 6-7 years, it's missing stuff
    We just need an MVP, find a good template and start filling in the blanks, if it sucks the recruiter will let me know, I'm wasting time thinking
    If I don't think about the layout - we don't even have a resume, I guess this is a neccesary step - Do I want work exp or not, courses or not?
    I have over 50 personal projects, scripts are technically a project, although not that impressive
    maybe do no work exp - just do courses/skills/projects with summaries - I should be able to hit all the buzzwords and keep it under a page with that
    My portfolios are good, my resume should just be a way for me to get them to bother looking at my portfolios - I'm already behind my goal
        This will probably take 2 days, 12th is new goal
    Maybe add genki I+II as a 'course' - completed both textbooks in ~4 months, shows I have a genuine interest to learn Japanese
    Can hyperlink each course + certificate to the github repo it's attached to; create 2 versions - would I trust a random dude sending me a resume
        with hyperlinks? seems sus, add hyperlinks after, create a second version with +HL tag in name at end
    I could combine my work experience + Courses into one master list and color code it, work experience = green, courses = plain
    Let's go with just courses for now, who cares if I stocked shelves when I was 19, I don't, why should they?
    At least I have an unbroken chain of employment with no real 'gaps' in my resume. regardless of how garbage pay/skill the employment was. Vs Dave Graeber - BS Jobs
    Can you explain this gap in your resume? 'Yes. That was when I was unemployed.' Vs Covid Cultists, Branch Covidians.
    Call myself a 'Freelance Developer' instead of 'Unemployed NEET' for the past 3 years. Perspective.
    can still say I went to UNB for a year, technically true, they just didn't let me in. Remote Classes. Lol, Lmao. 'Finding Myself' 'Gap Year'
        You paid 40k to be read verbatim the powerpoint slides to you by a noPants so called 'teacher' through a webcam. Lol, Lmao.
        Hope that special piece of paper "I Paid for my own IndoctrinateSean" was worth it. You should feel 'special'.
        If you were so smart, why are you taking experimental untested so called 'MedicASeans'? Doesn't seem that smart to me. 'Trust the $cience'
        I had to entirely reorient(ha) my life, again, because of you idiots, never again. If you want to be a brainwashed vaxcattle, do it to yourself,
        I'm gonna make like a canadian, and leave. Your decisions will never again affect me. God, I can't wait. Good Riddance.

Resume Layout/Formatting:
SectSeans:
Name(large text-no monikers-centered) - New Line -  
 Job Title (Full Stack Web Developer/Data Analyst-centered) - New Line -
Email / Phone / LinkedIn / Portfolio1 / Portfolio2 -- Line Break --
Skills -- Line Break --
Courses -- Line Break -- (ExplanASean at end, ) - Course Name / Provider(DoD + Location, Google, Etc) / Date-Started -- Date-Ended
Personal Projects / Work Experience(probably cutting this) -- Line Break -- Why not just put both my portfolios here as projects instead?
Da Gram / ECommerce Site / WeatherApp Vs CV1 / CV2 + Trade Offer Generator(Default Values = my terms)

Going to try this out first better formatting than microsoft word uses 'LaTex' - for typesetting, has fontawesome icons, :
https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV
sudo apt-get install texlive-full #installs texlive-full and dependancies
xelatex {your-cv}.tex #how to open a CV from terminal,
https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv/dfnvtnhzhhbm #awesome cv template
https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv-cover-letter/hzvvsbxccjhz #awesome cv cover letter template
https://www.latex-project.org/ #official site for LaTex
https://github.com/plorcupine/latex-fontawesome #Icons for resume
https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/ #Official Documentation,
starting a new project for a fancy CV, as a Web Dev, I should be able to use something fancier than Microsoft Word, the fanseanist
How do I hyperlink in LaTex and convert to a PDF? going to link each course/certificate to the github repo it's attached to
will do 4 versions, two with work experience(one with hyperlinks), and 2 without work exp(one with hyperlinks)
Still Installing, takes a while.. 'Pregenerating ConTeXt MarkIV format. This may take some time... ' #from terminal
https://debian-tex-maint.debian.narkive.com/KjtaGDTU/bug-913697-texlive-full-apt-hangs-at-pregenerating-context-markiv-format-this-may-take-some-time
#fix was holding 'enter' for a few seconds, install started running again, taking a break and then building resume resumes

How am I going to edit this without putting my personal info on the internet?
-keep default values in for name, IdentificASean, phone number, address, copy files when done at end and move to a new non-repo folder
turn into a PDF from there, we get backup copy of PDF on github, just need a note to change name again if we need to make changes

The example resume is 3 pages long, need to cut that down to 1. will add 'work' section last, if there is extra space
-if they ask for 'work experience' we can send them the one that is longer,
-can also add 'eduKsean' section with JIBC stuff
Going to start with adding the example repo, removing most of it, then adding in my stuff, play around with LaTex for a bit, see how it works,
-we need to create a 'skills' section at the very top, example repo doesn't have one. Place after 'Summary' Section
-everything else can stay the same,
-remove 'honors and awards' section
-top section has hyperlinks in the pdf, can copy those and use for 'certificates'
-do everything in reverse chronological order
-need to add a 'projects' section
-projects section links to both portfolios and 'trade offer'
-after adding the 'bones' of the resume we can add the 'muscles' of hyperlinks - save as a different name/project/file

12May2024 -
just tried to test LaTex, downloaded example(s), added to repo, tried to run with below:
xelatex resume.tex #supposed to build our resume with files
added 'awesome-cv.cls' fixed first errors, tried again and got a literal book of errors(100's of lines).
-and got a wall of errors, I think it might a reference error, since literally nothing seems to be working, might be
-folder layout/structure, maybe referencing the wrong files 'resume.tex' seems to be the main file, and
'awesome-cv.cls' appears to be similar to CSS

ERROR!

Ok, keep getting errors, above 'Missing \begin{document}' doesn't even exist, downloading repo as zip and starting from new
I'll be able to make edits here and just move the changed files over,
Ok, just got it to work from the downloaded repo, now I just need to change values and copy over, I must be missing a critical file
'xelatex resume.tex' #will run and create the PDF with the input values,
It creates 3 files 'resume.pdf' 'resume.log' and 'resume.aux' maybe some 'png's, I wasn't paying attention till after it worked
I now need to switch around the components to add my own customizeASean
Will open new repo in VSCode with '.code' make changes to those files, and transfer them over here for future use, so I don't waste a day looking through
-old harddrives and emails for a 7+ year old resume missing half my employment history and dates,

Remove 'honors and awards'
First page layout is done, now need 'summary' then add a 'skills' section then 'certifications'
then 'work experience' 'education' in a seperate layout/file - try to keep the above stuff under one page:
-'Projects' / 'Portfolios' SectSean - Add both portfolios / Trade-Offer Here,
Added 2 new sectSeans, still need to test if they look good as a PDF, should have hyperlinks to 'portfolio', also created 'skills'
Now just need to update 'certificates' and 'summary' and hope for a 1 pager, might actually be done tonight, if we push it
Just tested, 'portfolio' links didn't work, and there is a weird floating '2' for some reason.
