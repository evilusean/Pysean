I want to make a game and release it, it's best to do it through an LLC, but I don't want to be in canada, if I create a game in canada and it even has a modicum of success..
I am creating 100's of hours of work/lost time/10's of thousands of dollars cost for future sean because exit taxes/capital controls/captured communist postnational rentseeking parasite economic zone - Step 1) Escape.
If I pull this off, I've created my first source of passive income in a niche field, that will allow future Sean to build cool sh!t(and not be in canada) - sell 10,000 a year at 5$ a pop = 50k/annum, enough to Escape.
If canada joins the US as 51st state, america has the WORST tax structure in the world, where you are taxed globally, no matter where you are, that's one of the '"privileges"' for being a US '"citizen"'(taxcattle)

After getting an LLC, patent the idea, unique game idea, so someone can't just copy and paste my code and sell my 5$ game for 3.50$(lochness monster) - as much as I hate IP and patents.. -
You can write whatever words on paper you want can '"you"' enforce it? - If it isn't enforced, it doesn't exist. JUdicial JustUs = Laws are for little people. Legal immunizeASean. 
You think china cares about IP? Lol, lMAO. You going to enforce '"americas"' copyrights on them? They literally use the same factories to create the knockoffs and sell for 1000%+ profit.
If I worked in a patent office, I could be the next einSTEIN, no problem. If I owned a money printer, media, politicians, and stole half of everyones income for an infinite money glitch, I could also be a billionaire. 
To be corrupt in a corrupt society. It's not hard. You don't get rich in our corrupt society through hard work. Grift vs Graft. Behind every great fortune is a great crime. push '"the message"' or get banned
