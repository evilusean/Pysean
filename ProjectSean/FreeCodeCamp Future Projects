ServerRackStack+HomeLab+NAS(build my own apps for personal use+fun interactive house)-what would be the best tech stack for that?future sean problem-escape canada=first priority, can not build anything cool in decadent dystopia
  Could later upgrade server room for SaaS/IaaS side hustle, and do hosting services for passive income, while hosting/storing everything for my own personal use before it gets memoryholed
  Do the heavy lifting on server side(NextJS) create own DB's for storing all cool things I find 
Personal Blog=Could post to github and get 2 birds stoned, daily updates + personal thoughts + links, image/video hosting is too large, could do text based+links or host on my own rack
  updates to github markdown(with dates), and links to images/videos, while storing any images/videos locally to my own hardware for future use, 
Personal Website
Evidence Board(how people interconnect-weaponized autism edition=weApUnTIZEdM-find a software to build portfolios on people and how they interact with eachother-It's a big club, and you ain't in it-VisualizeASean)
  spend some time making a flow chart of every year of that MF'ers life, year by year, person by person, deconstructSean-Show me the man, and I will show you the crime, show me a corrupt man, and I will show you many crimes
  Appeal2Whom? ruleoflawl justUs- is it tru deau? MEWE, SNC lavalin, etc, etc... even if you can prove it.. then what? nothing ever happens - ever - sh!t floats to the top, fail up - CorruptSean is endemic - Escape.
  The fish rots from the head down, it's not a bug-it's a feature. Vs Ctrl Files, brownstone(memoryholed old definisean) vs black(mail)rock, you don't get in a position to influence the herd if you aren't totally controlled
  PowerBI / Python+R / Tableau / Adobe+Figma / Anything we can use to make pretty charts with some pictures
Automate the boring stuff AIChatbot/Email sender API call
New Resume
TranslaSean(japanese speech to  japanese text to translate to english readable=that's like 4 different API calls=very impressive portfolio resume project-solves real world problem)
Japanese learning app with push notificaSeans
Finish japanese number generator(half way done, layout is already started, just need input and output fix, and make sure it is using right words for denominaseans)
Encrypted Password storage (input old PW, receive new one/hash)
DicSeanAry - a simple script goes through a dictionary and replaces every tion/ / / with sean, saves it to an array and spits out the output for unlimited moniker works
Gym App-Burpees Situps Pushups etc until we can escape canada, and get back in da gym, apples walled garden doesn't allow us to side load our project, could build in react native, we already built a python script
