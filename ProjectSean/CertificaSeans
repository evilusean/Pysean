The Plan:
Finish Genki 1+2 Japanese(continue doing flashcards through others) -> A+ Cert Practice(can't afford test atm) -> FreeCodeCamp WebDev -> The Odin Project -> Harvard CS50
Sprinkle in a few personal python projects in during this, apply in winter/spring, hiring/visa process(months), escape canada by summer, never look back, bad dream

Multiple Harvard CS50- start with python, then main course, then web dev
