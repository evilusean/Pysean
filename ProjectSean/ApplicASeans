  Final Stage of Escape. After years of work. Countless hours, no days off in 2 years, I have finally got it all together and can escape these idiots forever
  Now instead of worrying about whatever the 'current thing' is and how the brainwashed idiots are going to respond, I just need to focus on saying 'I want the red one' (watashi wa hoshi akai ichi)
  In a few months I will be around people who are thin, can do grade 5 math, and aren't brainwashed by the TV for 40 years. Sipping strong zeros on a beach, wandering the safe, clean streets, with affordable houses.

20May2024: Applied to 5 Jobs on LinkedIn

21May2024: Applied to 5 more jobs on LinkedIn, 1 Interview, 2 contacts asking for ClarificaSean/Better Resume -  translated resume into Japanese(took hours to find new font/character set) Will need to double check the Japanese
  Used AI to write Japanese Resume because I suck at Kanji - Need to work on other longer resume with work experienced, some random recruiter told me to watch my 'tone'? and that my resume needed a native speaker to look over it

22May2024: Decided to do one LeetCode a day + work on 3 more NextJS projects for portfolio, taking my total from 6-9 on my Web Developer Portfolio, should show I have a solid grasp of NextJS + React = money/Escape
  spent all day looking at potential projects, settled on a NextJS KanBan Board - should take less than 4 days, maybe do an AI chatbot, or a Japanese large number generator/tester(actually need this), need 2 more new good projects
  all of my new projects MUST be hostable on vercel, I have 4 spaces left(on vercel-free tier) and most of my current stuff just links to github, 

23May2024: Fixing Resume, adding on Work Experience + EduKSean, making a resume that is longer than 1 page - then translating to Japanese
  Doing one Leetcode a day and going to start next project after fixing longer resume

24May2024: Created English version of ResuME, long form with work exp/eduKSean, now need to translate into Japanese, need to translate work experience/Header Titles + LocaSeans / EduKsean
  some kanji aren't translatable with the font/character set I'm using - so I need to go through the resume line by line and replace those with hiragana - Tedious - should be done today then starting applying again

25May2024: taking longer for TransLaSean than thought, spent all yesterday and got half of it done, need to go through line by line and translate each character that didn't format correctly and replace with hiragana, should be done soon
  then back to applying, still need to get it looked over by a native speaker, going to apply for Korea as well as Japan, and some based american states(there's like 3), and if I have time some Europe, anything is better than
  the decadent failed state dictatorship obedient oversocialized rent seeking parasite brainwashed normie tax/vax cattle unapologetically dumb petty tyrant infested frozen communist captured post nation sh!thole ponzi scheme of canada  
Going to add hiragana/Romaji version + English version in %comments% for my resume, I have no idea what half of this kanji means, still replacing the characters, tedious AF, AI generated, hopefully it's enough to Git A Job
  Finally finished long Japanese resume, took 2 days to add a single page, had to fix all the broken kanji characters and copy+paste hiragana in, because I don't have Japanese keyboard, now ready to get back to job hunt.
