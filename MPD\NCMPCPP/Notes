My Conf Files:
/etc/mpd.conf
~/.ncmpcpp/config

systemctl --user enable --now mpd.service
systemctl --user start mpd #ran this instead of 'mpd' and I didn't get the error?
systemctl --user enable mpd #To auto-start MPD upon login, typed this
sudo service mpd stop #if you got the following message: Failed to bind to '[::]:6600': Address already in use
mpd --verbose --stdout --no-daemon #run this to watch it update DB and debug

mpc update #   This re-scans your music directory and creates a database of stored tracks. 
mpc seekthrough +00:00:10 # Seek the current playing track 10s forward
mpc next : Skip to the next track
mpc prev : Play the previous track
mpc toggle : Play queue if paused, and pause if playing
mpc volume +2 : Raise volume by 2%. Use a different value or use minus instead of plus to reduce volume

mpd is a terminal run music player, where you can add visualizeASeans, you can also download apps on your phone to control the main machine, you can control it over the network once you get the configs right,
ncmpcpp is a client for running MPD in the terminal (looks aesthetik AF) - I can run over a network my entire media - music - languages - videos - from the terminal, in ascii, we burning the rice with this one boyz
'/etc/mpd.conf' '~/.mpd/mpd.conf' and '~/.ncmpcpp/config' are where the configs are located. I keep getting this error, I've been working on this since last night:
  server_socket: bind to '0.0.0.0:6600' failed (continuing anyway, because binding to '[::]:6600' succeeded): Failed to bind socket: Address already in use
  output: No 'audio_output' defined in config file

  alsa_output: Error opening default ALSA device: No such device or address

I just need to fix the config files, going to leave all resources/links here for future sean to figure out a fix, Welcome to the ricefields MF'er : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8a3gjt_Ar0

https://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp/installation/
Commented out everything in '/etc/mpd.conf' so the config files don't clash, after reading docs, they recomended '/etc/mpd.conf' so commented out other file, they also used another locASean '~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf'
'music_directory "~/Music"' #use absolute file directories, when running as root '~/' won't run as '/home/ArchSean/...' it will run as '/' (relative path)
Going to set up brand new folders on one of my spare partitions on HDD, 250 gigs for music videos and languages should be enough, created new directories, added dummy files(empty) with 'touch' command 
systemctl --user start mpd #ran this instead of 'mpd' and I didn't get the error?
systemctl --user enable mpd #To auto-start MPD upon login, typed this
#The “music directory” is where you store your music files. MPD stores all relevant meta information about all songs in its “database”. 
#Whenever you add, modify or remove songs in the music directory, you have to update the database, for example with mpc:
mpc update
#MPD has various storage plugins of which multiple instances can be “mounted” into the music directory. This way, you can use local music, file servers and USB sticks at the same time. Example:
mpc mount foo nfs://192.168.1.4/export/mp3
mpc mount usbstick udisks://by-uuid-2F2B-D136
mpc unmount usbstick
#MPD’s neighbor plugins can be helpful with finding mountable storages:
mpc listneighbors
sudo ncmpcpp #seems to resolve the connection problem, I still can't see any media,

Downloading some albums to test, only had one song downloaded from youtube with no metadata, that might be it

Fix : Will update the conf with correct settings, had to fix, comment out below, and next line changed directory + create a file:

db_file "/mnt/sdb2/Media/mpd/mpd.db"

I got everything up and running, added scripts to grab music from youtube, downloaded some discogs, now I want to add some aesthetics : ToDo's:
How to add embeded image to NCMPCPP window? and view currently played file, already have visualIzeASeans working, how to get album timestamp label correct 
fix metadata from youtube scripts, it's downloading and embedding the title name correctly, but not the Album timestamp(for checking new music), Artist, Songname, etc, also not deleting temp files correctly
Figure out how to symlink to other HDD's for language stuff, 250GB partiSean almost full
Figure out how to play it over multiple audio channels and a network, also practice setting up a NAS/Homelab/serverrack for large storage

Kunst : Embeded Image display in terminal:
https://github.com/sdushantha/kunst
https://github.com/nsxiv/nsxiv
sudo pacman -S imagemagick #install this to get kunst to work
export KUNST_MUSIC_DIR="/mnt/sdb2/Media/Music"
Kunst doesn't display in terminal, but you can force it 'keep above others' and have terminal player below, ghetto, but works. 
Ok, figured it out, Kunst only works with external images, so for discographys where they are in the same folder as the song, not embedded artwork from playlist downloads.
kunst --size 400x400 #use this command to open a new album art window of kunst, then right click select 'keep above others'

Aftter Testing, this script, does the same thing kunst, but requires more work to set up, I want the script to read the embeded image in the .mp3, not the one in the folder :
sudo pacman -S rxvt-unicode

https://gist.github.com/vlevit/4588882/

Going to try another method to load embedded files in a terminal :

https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/598
https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat/
https://radumirea.com/blog/ncmpcpp-with-album-art

Exiftool (Used to get embedded album art from .mp3):
https://exiftool.org/install.html
https://exiftool.org/index.html
https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/perl-image-exiftool/ 
https://github.com/evilusean/Pysean/blob/main/MPD%5CNCMPCPP/AlbumArtAuto.sh
sudo chmod +x AlbumArt.sh
cd /mnt/sdb2/Media/mpd/
./AlbumArt.sh
Future Sean : Make sure to add this to the config, in order to update kunst/terminal window - every time a song is played it will refresh -
#~/.ncmpcpp/config
execute_on_song_change = "/mnt/sdb2/Media/mpd/AlbumArt.sh"
I'm still missing a tonne of embeds, even with exfiltool, and a custom script, like ~25% of the !YT downloads have their embedded album art
So either I fix it or just add a default (I Should probably do this anyway) - been working on this since I woke up

ToDO: 
Create global hotkeys for next song/pause/etc

https://www.musicpd.org/doc/mpc/html/
Fix custom colors / change visualizer again
Add sym link files that point to other partitions, 250gigs goes fast
Fix image script - this is purely aesthetic, already put a day into this, not sure if worth, adds 0 funcSeanality to it, just looks nice - already installed like 5 packages and 2 custom scripts
