2025-ZZZ-Lutris-WineTricks-Winecfg-GE-Proton-Fix
I finally got ZZZ working : To fix ZZZ in the future, First, 
Download ZZZ through Lutris (Not sleepyloader, the original hoyo one)
Use Proton (System 10.9-This should be the default) for this install
Next, Download ZZZ through the launcher
Then, Create a Second game in lutris, this one will use GE-Proton10-4, use the wine prefix of the install directory, and use the downloaded game exe to be run by wine, you also need to figure 
  out how to get GE-Proton again, but that's future Sean's problem
I don't know why the launcher and game require 2 different protons, but they do
Next, right click the 'ZZZ' one go to 'Winetricks' and install - 
**Always Install First (Crucial):**
- `vcrun2022`: Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2022. Essential for almost all modern Windows games.
- `arial`: Microsoft Arial font. Prevents text display issues in launchers or game UI.
- I also dide corefonts
**Avoid (Unless Specific Error Explicitly Demands It):**
- `dxvk`: **DO NOT install via Winetricks if using a GE-Proton runner.** GE-Proton versions (like GE-Proton10-4) already include and manage their own optimized DXVK.
  Installing it separately can cause conflicts or downgrades. - Future Sean, I installed it anyways, so it might work
- `dotnet` versions (e.g., `dotnet48`, `dotnet6`, `dotnet8`): Only install if a _specific error message_ clearly indicates a missing .NET Framework version is the problem. 
  These can sometimes complicate the Wine prefix. `dotnet 40` `dotnet48` `dotnet9`
- `dxcompiler47`
- `d3xd9_43`
In Lutris: Right-click the game -> `Winecfg`.
- In the "Applications" tab, ensure "Default Settings" is selected.
- In the "Windows Version" dropdown at the bottom, select **"Windows 11"**.
- Click "Apply" then "OK".
After that, you need to download Webview2 from Microsoft to get past the 2FA (requires you to enter a code that is sent to your email, 
  the game doesn't have a built in browser, so you need to download one) :
`https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/` and then attempt to run it within the Wine prefix via Lutris's "Run EXE inside Wine prefix" option 
After that you should, in theory, be able to log in, spent almost an entire day trying to fix this - 
  I don't want to have to figure out which version goes where again for future Sean, it was tedious trial and error,
  and I finally figured out that each different version needs a different runner(?), idk why, but it works.
