### How to Increase Maximum Volume in PipeWire (Arch Linux)
I had a problem with the volume being capped at 90% on my new hyprland install, this is the fix

This method involves creating a custom PipeWire configuration file to override the default maximum volume limit.

**1. Create the PipeWire User Configuration Directory:** This command creates the necessary directory structure for user-specific PipeWire configuration files.

Bash

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/
```

**2. Create and Edit the Custom Volume Configuration File:** This command opens a new file named `99-custom-volume.conf` in the created directory using the `nano` text editor. The `99-` prefix ensures this file is loaded _after_ most other configuration files, allowing it to override default settings.

Bash

```
nano ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/99-custom-volume.conf
```

**3. Add the Configuration Content:** Paste the following lines into the `nano` editor. This tells PipeWire to allow a maximum linear volume of `3.0`, which corresponds to 300%. You can change `3.0` to `2.0` for 200%, or any other desired maximum.

Ini, TOML

```
context.properties = {
    # Set the maximum linear volume for all audio sources/sinks
    audio.volume.max = 3.0
}
```

- **To Save in `nano`:** Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` (for Yes to save), then `Enter`.

**4. Restart PipeWire Services:** These commands restart the PipeWire and PipeWire PulseAudio compatibility services. This is crucial for the new configuration to take effect without needing a full system reboot.

Bash

```
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse
