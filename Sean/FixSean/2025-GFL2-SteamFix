Attempted to install a new game to learn Japanese, kept crashing on phone, spent a few hours on steam and got it working, many steps though using GE-proton and webview2

Part 1: Install Necessary Tools

Install git, base-devel, wine, winetricks:

Bash

sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel wine winetricks
Install yay (AUR Helper) if you don't have it:

Bash

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
cd ..
Install protonup-qt using yay:

Bash

yay -S protonup-qt
Install protontricks using yay:

Bash

yay -S protontricks
Part 2: Setup GE-Proton for GFL2

Launch ProtonUp-Qt: (From your applications menu or protonup-qt in terminal)

Click "Add version".
Select "GE-Proton" as the release type.
Choose the latest GE-Proton version from the list (e.g., GE-Proton9-27).
Click "Install".
Close ProtonUp-Qt after installation.
Restart Steam.

Configure GFL2 in Steam:

In Steam Library, right-click Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium > Properties.
Go to Compatibility. Check "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool" and select the GE-Proton version you just installed.
Go to General. In "Launch Options", add:
UMU_ID=0 %command%
Close properties.
Part 3: Install & Configure WebView2 (Crucial for Launcher)

Before starting this part, ensure Steam is CLOSED COMPLETELY!

Get your GFL2 Proton Prefix Path:

The path will be: /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/3308670/pfx
For commands, it's useful to set it as a variable (replace YOUR_USERNAME and 3308670 if different):
Bash

GFL2_PREFIX_PATH="/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/3308670/pfx"
Update winetricks: (Important for webview2 verb detection)

Bash

sudo winetricks --self-update
Install WebView2 Runtime (Choose ONE method - try A first):

Method A: Using winetricks webview2 (Preferred if it works):

Bash

WINEPREFIX="$GFL2_PREFIX_PATH" winetricks webview2
Follow any prompts in the terminal or pop-up windows.
If you get "unknown arg webview2", this method failed. Proceed to Method B.
Method B: Manual Installation of Evergreen WebView2 Runtime (Fallback if Method A fails):

Download the Evergreen Standalone Installer (x64) from the official Microsoft WebView2 Runtime website. Save it (e.g., in ~/Downloads).
Open terminal and cd to the directory where you saved the .exe:
Bash

cd ~/Downloads
Run the installer within the GFL2 prefix (replace MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe with your actual downloaded filename):
Bash

WINEPREFIX="$GFL2_PREFIX_PATH" wine ./MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe
Follow the graphical installer prompts. Ensure it completes successfully.
Configure WebView2 in Winecfg (CRITICAL!):

Launch protontricks (select GFL2, then "Select the default wineprefix").
Choose "Run winecfg".
Go to the "Applications" tab.
Click "Add application...".
Navigate to and select the WebView2 executable within your GFL2 prefix's drive_c:
Option 1 (most common after successful install): $GFL2_PREFIX_PATH/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft/EdgeWebView/Application/<version_number>/msedgewebview2.exe (Replace <version_number> with the actual folder, e.g., 109.0.1518.78).
Option 2 (if msedgewebview2.exe is not found): $GFL2_PREFIX_PATH/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft/EdgeUpdate/MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe
With the correct executable highlighted in the list, change its specific "Windows Version" dropdown (at the bottom) to "Windows 7".
Click Apply, then OK. Close winecfg.
Apply renderer=gdi setting:

Launch protontricks (select GFL2, then "Select the default wineprefix").
Choose "Change settings" (or "Run winetricks" then "Change settings").
Check the renderer=gdi option.
Click OK.
Part 4: Launch Girls' Frontline 2

Restart Steam.
Launch Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium from your Steam library.
