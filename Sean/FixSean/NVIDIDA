Having a lot of trouble with my graphics card not running on 2 different OS' and using this to take notes. 
NVIDIA GPU RESOURCES (why I started this entire eneavour to begin with):

#below seems to be the fix for getting a wine/lutris game to run:

FIXED! -Night and day difference, instead of a 5 minute load time, it's less than 30 seconds, get vulkan to work with lutris and you win:

These are the steps that got it working in my case:
        Configuration (in lutris, for the game specific)
        System option tab
        Show advanced options
        "Enable NVIDIA prime refer offload" = on / Set to NVIDIA GPU
        Vulkan ICD loader = Nvidia proprietary / Install Vulkan on Arch, this took some work, but once I got it, changed everything
I forget exactly which sudo pacman -S vulkan package did it, but it was one of them, pretty sure top one wasn't it, use the bottom one
[root@ArchSean ArchSean]# export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/radeon_icd.i686.json:/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/radeon_icd.x86_64.json 
[root@ArchSean ArchSean]# export VK_DRIVER_FILES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json
