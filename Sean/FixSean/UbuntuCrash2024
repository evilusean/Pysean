using ubuntu, recently installed LaTex via apt-get, install was slow, had like 100 tabs open in google chrome, linux froze/crashed, I restarted then error. 
After reading error message, sounds pretty bad, making this file to store notes and error messages.

Rebooted, got an initial message of:

Rebooted into recovery mode:
/dev/mapper/vgubuntu-root contains a file system ith errors, check forced.
Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked list found
/dev/mapper/vgubuntu-root: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY. (i.e, without -a or -p options)
fsck exited with status code 4
done
Failure: File system check of the root filesystem failed
the Root filesystem on /dev/mapper/vgubuntu-root requires a manual fsck
