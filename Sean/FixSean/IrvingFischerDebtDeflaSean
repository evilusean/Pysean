# Preamble :
I didn't know where to put this, so I'm just putting it in this repo, it's not really a 'fix' it more of a 'we are EXPLETIVED'. This is just a working THEORY, you only see whose swimming naked when the tide goes out.
My goals/plans haven't changed in literally a decade. Step 1) Escape. - Just leaving this here for future Sean 
Most sane take on the H1B india '"WINning"' issue - Ironically, posted on twitter, by surrogate e-father figure Sam Al Haide : https://x.com/wigger/status/1873892448692486480

Just went down a rabbit hole (P < P + I) - What if, they are bringing in millions of indians not because of an imaginary labor shortage(it doesn't exist), but BECAUSE they are scammers? it is intentional -
population has gone up how many millions and GDP has remained stagnant? - even according to the CPLie - I personally beleive, we've been deeply negative for a while now. GDP per capita - 
When an indian/immigrant come into the US(150$ a day for hotels/85$ for food) or canada - they create more debt, buying things like credit cards, clothes, housing, cars, etc - creating more debt - 
canada is like the hotel california, '"man too poor to escape canada, chooses to stay"' - it sucks you of all economic value/utility and then casts your withered husk aside - jboomers are vampires-time=money=lifeEnergy
canada = where dreams go to die, unironic ponzi scheme, millenial(+)Z are the bagholders, you want half my income so you can afford to abuse the EXPLETIVE out of me? With 0 recourse, for decades. Lol, Lmao
the canadian govt is just a looting mechanism for.. '"others"' - we are in the looting the treasury and hiring foreign mercenaries stage. It took rome 100's of years from decline to collapse.pensions4HousingCollaterlol.
it also has the side bonus of cratering wages and JUIcing housing prices, for '"some reason"' - I'm not going to go into the coudenhove side of things, that's also a '"side benefit"' - Not one Apology, they double down.
I think canada has already had a lost decade(in REAL terms), and they have just been gaslighting us into beLIEving '"everything is awesome"' - interchangable economic units/debt cattle - 
contrary to popular beleif, most debt isn't created by central banks. It is created by private banks(yes, I know the fed res is private - but stay with me). - We have been captured since 1913 - a century of slavery.
When a loan is created, the bank creates money which is then spent into the economy as a debt bearing instrument - there is never enough money in the system to ever pay back all the loans. It is a scam.
If there is ever deflation on a large enough scale, people will default on ALL their loans, because the ownership of the asset is worthLess than what they are currently paying for it. 
This is why they NEED inflation, if the value of assets goes up (nominally) - this is behind the '"GREEN LINE MUST GO UP"' - phenemonen, it's a race to the bottom - if deflation ever takes hold, the entire system fails.
GREEN LINE MUST GO UP, or EVERYTHING goes down. If your society/company can't survive without constant bailouts(ins)/handouts/infinite taxes/infinite jeet/slavery - maybe it doesn't deserve to survive?
once the bonds fail, everything fails, so much for a 'Tier 1 asset' (Lol, Lmao.) - 'Reserve Requirement Ratio' is 0 - for those who know what that means (Lol, Lmao) - Crack Up Boom! Vs Debt Deflation
Bonds never made sense to me - a bond is more expensive if the interest rate is lower (don't you want a higher crit rate?) - it's counterintuitive - What is the signifigance of an inverted yield curve?

- In Fisher's formulation of debt [deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation "Deflation"), when the debt bubble bursts the following sequence of events occurs:
> Assuming, accordingly, that, at some point in time, a state of over-indebtedness exists, this will tend to lead to liquidation, 
> through the alarm either of debtors or creditors or both. Then we may deduce the following chain of consequences in nine links:
> 
> 1. Debt liquidation leads to distress selling and to
> 2. Contraction of the money supply, as bank loans are paid off, and to a slowing down of velocity of circulation. This contraction of the money supply and its velocity, precipitated by distress selling, causes
> 3. A fall in the level of prices, in other words, a swelling of the dollar. Assuming, as above stated, that this fall of prices is not interfered with by reflation or otherwise, there must be
> 4. A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies and
> 5. A like fall in profits, which in a "capitalistic," that is, a private-profit society, leads the concerns which are running at a loss to make
> 6. A reduction in output, in trade and in employment of labor. These losses, bankruptcies and unemployment, lead to
> 7. pessimism and loss of confidence, which in turn lead to
> 8. Hoarding and slowing down still more the velocity of circulation.

>     The above eight changes cause
>     
> 9. Complicated disturbances in the rates of interest, in particular, a fall in the nominal, or money, rates and a rise in the real, or commodity, rates of interest.
