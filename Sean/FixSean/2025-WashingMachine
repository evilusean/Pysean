Shuts off and show's 'oL' very old kenmore model, what it could potentially be :
The OL error on a Kenmore washing machine indicates an overload or unbalanced load, which causes the machine to shut off for safety. To fix this, first, 
  try redistributing the clothes in the drum to balance the load or remove bulky items. If the problem persists, unplug the machine for about 5 minutes to reset the system, 
  then check for a worn or damaged motor coupling or suspension, a faulty lid switch, or an issue with the control board or motor itself. 
Troubleshooting steps
Balance the load:
Open the washer and redistribute the clothes evenly in the tub.
Remove any bulky items that may be causing an imbalance, like a single sheet.
Try running a smaller or balanced load to see if the error is resolved.
Reset the washer:
Unplug the washing machine from the power outlet for at least 5 minutes.
Plug it back in and try running a cycle.
Inspect for mechanical issues:
Check the motor coupling and drive belt for wear or damage.
Inspect the suspension rods or shock absorbers for damage.
Make sure the washer is level on the floor.
Check other components:
Ensure the lid switch is working correctly and engaging properly.
Clean any filters, as a clog can cause drainage issues that may trigger this error.
When to call a professional:
If the error continues after trying these steps, there may be a more serious issue, such as a faulty motor or control board.
A technician can properly test these components for faults.
