Problem= invalid partition table
Broke on morning of June 3 2023
broke After downloading some resume templates(zipped-pdfs) and epsteins foia(400+ mb, PDFile)
partitioned C drive 2?ish months before to add more space 64 -> 128 gb
problem originally began where it would continuously boot to BIOS, changed some bios settings and now get to 'invalid partition table'
downloaded windows 7 isos, added to USB drive, still won't boot properly
attempting to repair with chkdsk
opened up laptop, removed dust, hard drives still intact
bios can still read hard drives 
attempted to update bios with ez flash-did not work
downloaded new copy of windows 7, attempted to boot from USB, didn't work
?using apple and boot camp to create USBs-might be incompatible-not/can't use rufus
  potential fix-dual booting from boot camp- download rufus- and flash usb from that-ensure to use GPT
  dual purpose-will also check if the bootleg iso works for install, as well
?potentially need a new usb stick to install, might be incompatible
?potentially try using a windows 7 installation disk
?if all else fails attempt to boot from newer version of windows and install that(all data lost, months of progress gone)
  windows 7 was removed from microsofts support in january 2023- can't download from official site
attempting to recover data for MC saves, and all image downloads(havn't backed up in months-of lost progress, 50-100 images a day)

Attempted to put mac into dual boot mode using boot camp - after partitioning for ~hour, on restart went to a screen that said 
  "no bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key"
  so the USB i used for windows 7 is NOT BOOTABLE-
  returned to macintosh screen with partition in tact by holding the 'option' key on restart
Attempting to create bootable USB drive on linux using  balenaeEtcher-told us to use woeUSB-will need to format old USB first

bumped bootable usb while attempting to write OS, attempting to fix
using terminal to repair an old corrupted usb drive on macos:
diskutil list #finds the usb
diskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk2 #checks usb, received back error message:
  Nonexistent, unknown, or damaged partition map scheme
  If you are sure this disk contains a (damaged) APM, MBR, or GPT partition
  scheme, you might be able to repair it with "diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk2"  
diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ BackupMaster disk2 #format the usb, recieved error:
  Started erase on disk2
  Unmounting disk
  Creating the partition map
  Error: -69760: Unable to write to the last block of the device
diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk2 #attempt to repair corrupted usb, received error:
  Nonexistent, unknown, or damaged partition map scheme
  If you are sure this disk contains a (damaged) APM, MBR, or GPT partition map,
  you can hereby try to repair it enough to be recognized as a map; another
  "diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk2" might then be necessary for further repairs
  Proceed? (y/N) y
  Error repairing map: MediaKit reports bad partition or no map found (-5324)
USB drive still not working, attempting updates on macos for next step- havn't used mac in years, outdated

attempt 2:
diskutil list #find usb
diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/disk2 #forced unmount
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=1024 count=1024
diskutil eraseDisk free EMPTY /dev/disk2 #tried to erase, got error:
  Error: -69760: Unable to write to the last block of the device
Spent 12 hours trying to fix a 5$ corrupted USB..
