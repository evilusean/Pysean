Problem= invalid partition table
Broke on morning of June 3 2023
broke After downloading some resume templates(zipped-pdfs) and epsteins foia(400+ mb, PDFile)
partitioned C drive 2?ish months before to add more space 64 -> 128 gb
problem originally began where it would continuously boot to BIOS, changed some bios settings and now get to 'invalid partition table'
downloaded windows 7 isos, added to USB drive, still won't boot properly
attempting to repair with chkdsk
opened up laptop, removed dust, hard drives still intact
bios can still read hard drives 
attempted to update bios with ez flash-did not work
downloaded new copy of windows 7, attempted to boot from USB, didn't work
?using apple and boot camp to create USBs-might be incompatible-not/can't use rufus
  potential fix-dual booting from boot camp- download rufus- and flash usb from that-ensure to use GPT
  dual purpose-will also check if the bootleg iso works for install, as well
?potentially need a new usb stick to install, might be incompatible
?potentially try using a windows 7 installation disk
?if all else fails attempt to boot from newer version of windows and install that(all data lost, months of progress gone)
  windows 7 was removed from microsofts support in january 2023- can't download from official site
attempting to recover data for MC saves, and all image downloads(havn't backed up in months-of lost progress, 50-100 images a day)

Attempted to put mac into dual boot mode using boot camp - after partitioning for ~hour, on restart went to a screen that said 
  "no bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key"
  so the USB i used for windows 7 is NOT BOOTABLE-
  returned to macintosh screen with partition in tact by holding the 'option' key on restart
