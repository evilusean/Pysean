The rapid clicking sound from your pump control box (Model CB05412) indicates that the start relay is rapidly engaging and disengaging. This usually happens when the control box is attempting to start the submersible pump motor but is failing to do so successfully, likely due to a problem with the pump itself, the wiring to the pump, or a major component failure within the control box. 
Common Causes & Troubleshooting Steps
⚠️ Safety First: Turn off all power to the pump system at the main circuit breaker before inspecting any components. 
Potential Cause 	Description	Actionable Step
Failed Pump Motor	The pump motor may be seized or damaged (e.g., due to sediment buildup or worn bearings) and cannot start, causing the control box's relay to click rapidly.	This requires the pump to be pulled from the well and inspected by a professional.
Faulty Start Relay	The relay itself might be the issue, preventing the correct signal or power from reaching the pump motor.	A new control box lid/assembly (which contains the relay and capacitor) can be installed. This is a common and relatively simple fix if the motor is sound.
Bad Capacitor	The start capacitor provides a power boost to initiate the motor's spin. A faulty or bulging capacitor will prevent the motor from starting.	Visually inspect the capacitor for bulging or leaks. A multimeter can be used to test the capacitance.
Incorrect Voltage/Wiring	The system might not be receiving the full 230 volts required, or there could be a wiring error, especially if components were recently installed.	Use a multimeter to verify you have the correct voltage (around 240VAC) at the pressure switch and the control box terminals.
Faulty Pressure Switch	The pressure switch, which tells the pump when to turn on and off, may be malfunctioning due to corrosion or bad contacts.	Check the pressure switch for proper operation and correct wiring.
Next Steps
Verify Power: First, use a multimeter to confirm the incoming voltage to the control box and the pressure switch is correct (~240V).
Inspect Components: Turn off power and visually inspect the capacitors within the control box for any signs of damage.
Test Internal Components/Replace Box: You can test individual components (relay, capacitor) with a multimeter, or as many homeowners do, replace the entire control box cover assembly, as it's an inexpensive troubleshooting step.
Check Pump/Wiring: If a new control box does not resolve the issue, the problem is most likely the wiring leading down the well or the pump motor itself, which will require a professional to pull the pump for inspection. 
Due to the electrical nature and potential complexity of well pump systems, if you are not comfortable performing these tests yourself, it is recommended to contact a qualified electrician or well pump professiona
