Omlouvám se. = I'm Sorry
Jak se máš? = How are you? (The meaning of se máš is better understood in its infinitive form mít se ("to be doing"), for example, mít se dobře ("to be doing well"))
  Jak se máš? is used when addressing only one person. The š letter indicates the singular form (as well as noting the question as informal). 
  Jak se máte with the te at the end indicates the plural form used either with more than one person, i.e. Ahoj kluci, jak se máte ("Hello boys, how are you?"), 
  or used as a polite form towards people we cannot be casual with, i.e Jak se máte, paní Malá? ("How are you doing, Mrs. Malá?").
Děkuju, dobře. = Well, thanks
díky, dobře = ("thanks, I'm fine").
jo, dobře = ("I'm fine"), 
jde to = ("Not too bad"), 
výborně = ("Great").
čau / nazdar = There are also other informal greetings that Czech people use on a daily basis, although their tone is very casual and they can only be used among friends or family.
čau mami = ("Hi, mom")
Tak čau, já jdu. = "See you then, I'm going."
