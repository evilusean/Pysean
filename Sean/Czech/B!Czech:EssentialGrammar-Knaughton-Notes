This is styled an ‘essential’ grammar, and is certainly not anything like
a comprehensive grammar (mluvnice) of Czech (aeetina) – the Czech language (aeskp jazyk)

Pronunciation and orthography – výslovnost a pravopis = Page 14 ========================================================================================================================================================================
2.1 = samohlásky = Vowels
Vowel letters a, e, i/y, o, u represent sounds which are quite close to the English vowel sounds in ‘tuck, tech, tick, tock, took’ respectively.
There’s no difference in sound between i and y, but the spelling affects the pronunciation of preceding d, t, n – see below.
With acute signs added (á, é, í / ý, ó, ú) these vowels are pronounced with longer duration: roughly like English ‘ah, eh, ee, aw, oo’.
The long vowel ú is normally spelt r (with a kroufek ‘little circle’) except as the ﬁrst letter in a word.
Word stress is on the ﬁrst vowel (long or short).
A, Á:ano, ale, dal, dál, málo, malá
E, É:ne, den, nese, krém, malé, milé
I, Í/Y, O: byl/bil, syn, sýr, bílý, milý, malý
O, Ó:ona, slovo, doma, gól, móda, haló
U, Ú/ů:ruka, ruku, domu, dům, úloha, domů
There are also three diphthongs (diftongy, sequences of two vowels within a single syllable) in which the ﬁrst vowel, pronounced as above, moves into a very short u or w sound.
The commonest is OU:
OU: bouda, malou, náhodou, nesou
The other two diphthongs appear in loanwords:
AU:auto car, automobile, autobus ‘bus’, restaurace ‘restaurant’
EU:pneumatika ‘(pneumatic) tyre’, neutralita ‘neutrality’
Other vowel letter sequences are pronounced as two syllables:
IE:Anglie ‘England’, as if spelt -ije (for J see below)
IO:rádio ‘radio’, as if spelt -ijo
AO:‘a-o’ e.g. kakao ‘cocoa’

2.2 = souhlásky = Consonants 
Consonant letters b, d, f, g (as in ‘good’), h, k, l, m, n, p, s (as in ‘sun’), t (as in ‘stop’), x and z are pronounced much the same as in English.
However:
K, P, and T lack the typical English ‘post-aspiration’, a slight puff of air 
following them, unless they come at the end of a word:
kilo, ruka, pil, koupil, ten, to, ta
but are post-aspirated in ﬁnal position in words like: buk, lup, mít.
H is pronounced further back, more deeply, hollowly, than the English equivalent:
holit, haló, mnoho, nahý
CH must be distinguished from H, and is pronounced like Scottish ‘loch’ (not like a regular English CH):
chudý, chyba, ucho, chladno
R is brieﬂy trilled, like a Scottish R, and pronounced in all positions:
rád, ruka, Karel, hora, pár, sestra, horko
Both R and L can act like vowels, creating syllables of their own:
krk, bratr, plný, nesl
One silly Czech tongue-twister suggests (misleadingly) that the language lacks vowels. The saying literally means ‘stick (your) ﬁnger through (your) neck/throat’:
Strč prst skrz krk.
QU and W turn up in occasional loanwords with retained foreign spelling.
western [vestern], WC [vétsé], quasi- (pronounced and more often spelt kvazi- ).
S is pronounced [z] in words for ‘-isms’ ending in -ismus and in a few other loanwords and names:
Josef [ Jozef ], feminismus [feminizmus] (now also spelt -izmus)
The letter X occurs in loanwords, where it is mostly pronounced [ks], e.g. extra ‘extra’, except in words beginning in ex- plus a vowel, if the ex- is not perceived as a tacked-on preﬁx. Here it is pronounced [gz],
e.g. existovat ‘to exist’, exil ‘exile’, exotickp ‘exotic’.
Z is as in English ‘zebra’, e.g. zebra, zima ‘winter’

2.2.1 = Soft consonants – měkké souhlásky
For Czech spelling and grammar it is important to identify the so-called ‘soft’ consonants as a distinct group.
These are the consonant letters č, d’, ň, ř, š, ť, ž plus letters c and j.
All the soft consonants except for c and j are written with a diacritic
sign over the letter, generally written and printed ˇ , and called a háček ‘small hook’.
‘Soft’ t and d are also hand-written with a háček, but in lower-case
print this is printed as t’, d’, using a closely linked apostrophe. The upper-case printed forms are n, m.
C is pronounced as one sound like ts in bats (not like K):
cesta, noc, práce, pecka = approx. [tsesta], [nots], [prátse], [petska]
J is like y in yes:
jeden, já, moje, ahoj
Č, Š, and Ž are pronounced much like chin, shin, and vision respectively:
čeká, čech, Angličan, klíč
šest, máš, špatný, píšeš
žena, život, můžeš, muži
Ď/d’, Ť/t’ and Ň/ ň are close to the sounds in British English duty, tune, Ň new (when pronounced ‘dyooty’, ‘tyoon’, ‘nyoo’):
d’ábel, Lád’a, mad’arský
t’uknout, chut’, kot’ata
píseň, promiň, koňak
The true Czech speciality is Řř, a single sound which is pronounced like an energetic brieﬂy trilled R with additional contact from the tip of the tongue, producing some extra slightly ž-like friction. It can be heard in
the name of the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák. It is voiceless at the end of a word (before a pause, see 2.5 below):
Dvořák, řeka, říkat – lékař, keř, nekuř
The sound Ř also occurs after other consonants. It is also voiceless when it comes immediately next to a voiceless consonant:
dříve, zavřít – tři, při, přece, křičet
It also occurs sometimes between two consonants, but does not add its own syllable:
hřbi|tov – křti|ny (each two syllables only!)
It is necessary to distinguish j from R, e.g. hořký ‘bitter’ but horký ‘hot’,
řvát ‘to roar’ but rvát ‘to tear’ (these two words are monosyllabic).

2.2.2 = Consonant 
Czech is a language with many consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel sequences and some familiar consonant clusters which should not cause an English speaker any difﬁculties, e.g.
máme, duby, matka, ostrý
But it does present some clusters which are unfamiliar, especially certain combinations of consonants in word-initial position:
