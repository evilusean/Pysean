Github Can not save the letters with the arrow on top so I marked them with 'letter<' note the '<' points to the letter, they default to 'a' 'p' or 'e' when copied and pasted in
Also the long vowels don't appear either, I marked them with a 'letter-'. note the '-' dash
Added a new file that I can use for vocabulary called 'Czech_Vocab.tex' in this repo, 'pdflatex' allows use of modern latin library which can handle the Czech letters
Created a new '.tex' document, thought it was github when pasting, it's not, it's the PDF I'm copying from, in order to get the words with correct letters, will need to translate from google and copy paste here
