## Preamble :
Going to work on getting to Slovakia, Why am I now attempting to learn a second(third? fourth?) language? To escape rent seeking parasite infested ponzi scheme post national economic zone failed state of canada(where dreams go to die), and actually to not pay half my income in taxes, and half of what remains in rent, and then inflation. My goals haven't changed in literally over a decade, what I saw then has not only not improved, it's gotten multitudes worse. If you protest working/living conditions, they just tax you infinite amounts, import infinite indians, and then subsidize their wages with the taxes they stole, while propping up the jboomers, the same people who sold you down the river 40+ years ago, get to live comfortably for their betrayal as the fire rages behind them, watch it burn from a safe distance. Everyone is playing musical chairs here, but there are no chairs, and the music stopped a while ago. I can get citizenship by descent in Slovakia, so that is the goal. I can't wait till living in canada will be nothing more than a bad memory, bad dream in the rear view mirror, and I never have to look at, listen to, or speak with another brainwashed mind broken canadian for as long as I live. The Dream. The canadian dream = Step 1) Escape.

### 2:Grammatical Genders-2024-11-17
- There are three genders in Slovak: masculine, feminine, and neuter. They are used not only for people, but also for objects, animals, plants, etc. To use a noun correctly, you need to know its gender.
- The gender of a noun is determined by its ending.
- Adjectives always agree in gender with the noun they describe. If a noun is masculine, then the accompanying adjective must be in the masculine form.
	|Masculine|suffix **-ý**|vysok**ý** muž|
	|Feminine|suffix **-á**|pekn**á** žena|
	|Neuter|suffix **-é**|mal**é** dieťa|
- This is also true for demonstrative pronouns that point to a noun:
	|**Masculine: TEN**|To je nejak**ý** muž. **Ten** muž je vysoký.|
	|**Feminine: TÁ**|To je nejak**á** kniha. **Tá** kniha je veľmi dobrá.|
	|**Neuter: TO**|To je nejak**é** auto. **To** auto je nové.|
