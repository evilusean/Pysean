since Slovak is an obscure language, spoken by 6 million people.. allegedly, I can't find any vocabulary lists on youtube to play in the backgroud as I work on other stuff</br>
Started this repo to store all the scripts and stuff I need to use TTS program 'Piper' supports Slovak, is free, runs locally. </br> 
[https://github.com/rhasspy/piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) </br>
https://www.101languages.net/slovak/most-common-slovak-words/ </br>
Combine the 2 above, and I have the 1,000 most common slovak words on repeat until I am fluent(ish) and can communicate at a level slightly above charades. </br>
Will need 2 voices - One for Slovak - and one for English </br>
