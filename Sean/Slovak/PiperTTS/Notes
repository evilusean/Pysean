''' #hit with these errors, just ignoring for now, if something breaks I know where I need to go to fix it, can be fixed by 'pip install ____' all of the above, or adding them to PATH, which is tedious
sudo apt install piper #installed again through sudo
Something broke, new errors below:
"""
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/piper", line 36, in <module>
    from piper.application import Application
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'piper.application'
""" #I guess adding to PATH was important, trying to fix
https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/341
sudo ln -nsf /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/piper /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/piper #didn't work, python version is different, 3.10.12
Still broke, updating ubuntu, and restarting, 
Restart fixed it, 'Did you try turning it off and on again?' 
Ran below command '
echo 'Welcome to the world of speech synthesis!' | piper \
  --model en_US-lessac-medium \
  --output_file welcome.wav
' #will take your current working directory, download the speech package(will need this later for slovak)model automatically, create a '.wav' file with that newly downloaded speech model in your current directory,
Now I need to figure out a way for it to bounce back and forth from Slovak to English after an '=' sign and slovak on a newline, need to fiddle with the commands and read docs to see what can be done, also download slovak package
Spent all day making the script, finally got it to work, but piper can't find the voices, here is the fix, 
piper --update-voices -m en_US-lessac-medium #still didn't work, will need to update the code manually another way, 
run this in repo '
echo 'Welcome to the world of speech synthesis!' | piper \
  --model en_US-lessac-medium \
  --output_file welcome.wav
'
then run this '
echo 'Dobrý deň' | piper \
  --model sk_SK-lili-medium \
  --output_file welcome.wav
'
then update the script with the location of the downloaded '.onnx' and '.json' 
    subprocess.run(
        [
            "piper",
            "-m",
            "/media/sean/MusIX/Piper/sk_SK-lili-medium.onnx",  # Replace with the path to your Slovak model
            "-c",
            "/media/sean/MusIX/Piper/sk_SK-lili-medium.onnx.json",  # Replace with the path to your Slovak config
            "-f",
            os.path.join(slovak_audio_dir, filename + ".mp3"),
            # "-s",  # Remove the speaker argument as it's not needed
            "--sentence-silence",
            "0.5", # Add a 0.5 second silence between sentences
        ],
        input=text.encode("utf-8"),
    )

Had an error, when converting my second batch - switched from '.mp3' to '.wav' which piper is default used for, it wasn't that - you need to remove all strange characters before doing a batch So...
 No '...', ',' '/' '?' etc, spent half an hour trying to figure out what broke,

they are labeled numerically, so I just need to sort and the english/slovak should match up together, create a VLC playlist for each batch, and then a master playlist of all the small ones for a new vocab playlist
Everything added to anki deck, I need to try for the summit tommorrow, and start the 1,000 most common slovak words tomorrow, I can't use API calls because google blocks those after <10 attempts, has to be done manually~ days gone
