''' #hit with these errors, just ignoring for now, if something breaks I know where I need to go to fix it, can be fixed by 'pip install ____' all of the above, or adding them to PATH, which is tedious
sudo apt install piper #installed again through sudo

sudo ln -nsf /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/piper /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/piper #didn't work, python version is different, 3.10.12
Still broke, updating ubuntu, and restarting,
