Trying Coqui-AI-TTS - previously used piper TTS - it's meant to run on a raspberry pi - some smaller words are unintelligible - trying a new larger model for slovak vocab lists -
if I have to look up what the word is on a CSV, that's not good enough </br>

For Future Sean : 'source TranslaSean3.9/bin/activate' #to run the venv with TTS installed for creating more slovak/jp files
    Also remember, you will need to download voices again and the 'pause' and change every directory again before using,
