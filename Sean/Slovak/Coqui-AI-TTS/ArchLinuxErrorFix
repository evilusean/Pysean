Copying this here for next time I need to fix the issue, I still have the old scripts/voices/models so can just reinstall 
    when I need to, I kind of just want to wait for it to be usable with the current version of python I'm using
    that way I can run it in a terminal, as a one liner without having to prepend(ap?) -python3.9 and set up a venv
    which is tedious, I'll just delete the old python file and venv when I can update, if they don't fix it
    I can just use it this way, although tedious - it does very good slovak - and I already put half a week into the scripts
    Will need to change/update input/output directories, voices/models are good, try not to install them on /root use /home 

Second day, everything booted correctly, most things installed, going to install Coqui-AI / OpenAI-Whisper and Anki. Get back to languages, Step 1) Escape.
Location of Python `pip` packages: '/home' #still have 80+ gigs on SSD for home, after reinstalling, don't have to worry about this going to '/root' - less than 10 left
pip show numpy #Location: /home/user/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages.
Both of these are >5 years old, both recomend pacman? - docs say if not using a venv, it can conflict with packages in /usr/ - which is on my root dir - which is already half full

Going to use Pip, don't want to add more strain on '/root' - pip installs to '/home' 

Coqui-AI:
pip install tts #got below error message, in VScode, computer is yelling at me, maybe pip is a bad idea
error: externally-managed-environment
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try 'pacman -S
    python-xyz', where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Arch-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using 'python -m venv path/to/venv'.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Arch packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have python-pipx
    installed via pacman.
pacman -S python-<packagename> # use this syntax to install via pacman
I tried with pacman(file not found), without(big mad warning), now going to try with a venv to get around the warning -
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Python/Virtual_environment
python -m venv <envname>
python -m venv TranslaSean #created it in my 'PySean' repo that auto uploads to github, added a .gitignore to ignore it. Should be able to DL with pip now
python virtualenv envname
python virtualenv TranslaSean # command didn't work, maybe already in? thought it was like 'cd' for when creating new dirs
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Python/Virtual_environment#Activation
source envname/bin/activate
source TranslaSean/bin/activate # nm, disregard last, this works to 'turn on' the venv - type this command to 'use' the venv, use it from the 'Pysean' directory
deactivate # type this to leave venv
tried to install using the command given from 'https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/tree/dev#installation' - 'pip install TTS' -  still won't work even after installing venv and updating pip
from docs: 'python >= 3.9, < 3.12..' - my python --version is 3.12.4 - is that it? just need to create a new venv with  reduced version of python?
https://gist.github.com/beci/53a08cb73ec8539b895a64bebbd49734
sudo pacman -S python3.9 #installing 3.9 with pacman - didn't work?
yay -S python39 #this works, had to lookup 
python3.9 -m venv TranslaSean3.9 #creating the python 3.9 venv
source TranslaSean3.9/bin/activate #go into newly created venv
pip install TTS #works!
pip -m uninstall [packagename] #going to need to uninstall when TTS get's updated to work with newest version of python, each time I download - multiple gigs off of /root gone for each model
