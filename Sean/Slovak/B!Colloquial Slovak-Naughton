Slovakia, with its capital Bratislava has been an independent state since Czechoslovakia split at the end of 1992. This 'Velvet Divorce' was preceded in 1989 by the 'Velvet Revolution', which saw the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia
Far less visited by foreigners than the Czech Republic or Austria, Slovakia, with its mountains, ski resorts, remote country districts, viniculture, castles and old towns, merits more attention (I save up, I can buy a castle. Step 1)
Population 5.432 million + 1(me)
Up to 1918 Slovakia had been part of the kingdom of Hungary since the tenth century. After the First World War, and the fall of the Habsburg-ruled Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Slovakia became part of Czechoslovakia. During the Second World War it was briefly semi-independent under Nazi hegemony, before going back to Czechoslovakia, soon under communist rule.
The Slovak language is very close to Czech, both in vocabulary and in grammar, and Czechs can understand Slovak quite easily.
Sometimes however you find that a word in common everyday use which is also in Czech is rejected as 'incorrect' by guardians of the language, in favour of another Slovak equivalent.
