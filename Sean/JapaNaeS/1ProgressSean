街 = Machi = "Town" as in a downtown or built-up area - used for a small district within a town, such as 中華街 (Chinatown). ウォール街 is used for Wall Street.

Girls (How many words are there for girls? alot, apparently, each of them has their own ages, remember all of them, mis(mrs?miss?)-aging a josei is the beginning of many isekais) :
女の子 (おんなのこ) = *all girls from newborns to roughly mid-teens - *in slang usage, other young women
女子 (じょし) = joshi =  Girl, young woman - *when referring to individuals, covers a similar age range to 女の子 - *when referring to “girls” as a whole, covers a much broader range, through women in their 30’s 
少女 (しょうじょ) = shōjo = *refers to girls that are anywhere from elementary school age to mid-teens - *has a romantic feeling, as in, it captures the “idealized” image of the word “girl”
処女 = shojo = female virgin
乙女 (おとめ) = *basically the same as 少女 but even more romantic and poetic - *also sometimes used refer to young unmarried women in a bit of an archaic sense - 
  *sometimes the kanji 少女 can be read as おとめ, but this is non-standard and if intended likely to be marked with furigana
娘 (むすめ) = *in a literal sense, a daughter of any age - *in a broader sense, young unmarried women
女児 (じょじ) = *girls from kindergarten to low-grade elementary school age, basically from first starting school to a few years later - *more likely to be written than spoken (imagine a school pamphlet or something)
ガール = *rarely used alone, but appears in many other words
ギャル = *a young, energetic woman, stereotypically with heavy make-up and… less interest in intellectual activities - *as such, use caution with this word
幼女 (ようじょ) = *little girl - *relatively uncommon relative to other words discussed
女性 (じょせい) = josei = Woman, female. *female of any age - *typically if specifically referring to girls, it would be in the form of 女性の with some “youth-specific” word following, as in 女性の生徒 (female student)
女子高生 = The abbreviation JK stands for (joshi kōsei, ja:女子高生), a female high school student

Interesting Kanji :

Rendaku (連濁, Japanese pronunciation: [ɾendakɯ], lit. 'sequential voicing) - so, there isn't only just the kunyomi/onyomi readings (some have over 5, just know, bro) - there is also rendaku :
 Rendaku, or sequential voicing, is a Japanese linguistic phenomenon that occurs when a voiceless consonant at the beginning of the second element of a compound word is replaced with a voiced consonant: 
Example: Hito (人) + hito (人) = hitobito (人々). In this example, the first consonant (h) in the second word (hito) becomes voiced (ひ → び)
