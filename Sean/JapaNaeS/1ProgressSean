N1 = High school level of Japanese, they spent 12 years of school(18 of life) learning kanji to get to that level, if I can do it in less than 4, that would still be wildly succesful -
 N2 for jobs in ~2 years is still very impressive, I've only been studying daily for 1 year, need to add some realism to the mix, I shouldn't expect to be working there in >6 months of studying

WaniKani Level (Apply again at 16) : 8

Rendaku (連濁, Japanese pronunciation: [ɾendakɯ], lit. 'sequential voicing) - so, there isn't only just the kunyomi/onyomi readings (some have over 5, just know, bro) - there is also rendaku :
 Rendaku, or sequential voicing, is a Japanese linguistic phenomenon that occurs when a voiceless consonant at the beginning of the second element of a compound word is replaced with a voiced consonant: 
Example: Hito (人) + hito (人) = hitobito (人々). In this example, the first consonant (h) in the second word (hito) becomes voiced (ひ → び)
