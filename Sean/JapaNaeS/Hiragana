Dakuten (濁音) Referes to adding ゛two little marks in the top right, changing the pronunciation of k-line(g), s-line(z), t-line(d) and h-line(b)
Handakuten (半濁点) Refers to adding a ゜circle to the top right, changing the pronunciation of h-line to (P)
Youon(拗音)Another group of additional Japanese hiragana called 拗音 youon is formed by adding smaller version of ya, yu or yo (ゃ, ゅ or ょ)to hiragana
  Remove the 'I' sound at the end of the character it was added to
Sokuon (促音) When a small tsu (っ) called 促音 (sokuon) is added, it means the following consonant is geminated or doubled (double consonants). 
  This small (っ) forms the double consonants with the following character. This also means after we pronounce the previous consonant, we pause for 
  the same amount of time used to pronounce the consonant, then continue to pronounce the following consonant.
Chouon (長音)Long Vowels. For long vowels, we normally add a second vowel following the first vowel. 
In Japanese they use corner brackets for quotes instead of "" quotation marks so you won't confuse Dakuten
い = i #acts as a suffix to most adjectives in japanese
な = na # acts as another suffix particle to connect 2 nouns (clean room)
お = o #commonly found at beginning of words to imply politeness
か = ka #question marking particle; when used at the end of a sentence, denotes a question
つ = tsu # has a tiny version called chisai tsu(小さい「っ」) turns a consonant into a double consonant
  when found at the end of a word, acts a glottal stop
じ and ぢ are both ji, most of the time you use じ, ぢ is rarely used
の = no #particle used to denote possession
は = ha # ha(wa) is a topic marking particle, the word or phrase that comes before it is the topic of the sentence, when used like this sounds like wa
へ = he # he is the particle used to indicate the place towards which something is moving, pronounced as 'e' when used like this
は = ha and ほ = ho, both have a HOop, ほ = ho has 2 horizontal lines, は = ha ha has HAlf the lines, ほ = ho, ho has the wHOle amount
を = o, wo(o) is the object marking particle, never in a word, the word before it is the object of the sentence
ん = n #you can never start a word with ん = n, it can only be foun in the middle or at the end, pronunciation 'n' 'ng' 'm' depends on word coming next
