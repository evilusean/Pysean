"""
Japanese particles are small words that indicate relations of words within a sentence. They follow other words such as nouns, verbs, adjectives are parts of a sentence. 
Some but not all can be compared to prepositions in English. The Japanese language uses a total of 188 particles.
"""
Commonly Used:
Particle = Formation = Example = Explanation
は (wa) = [ A ] wa [ B ] desu. = [ A ] is [ B ]. = 昨日は雨だった。 = Kinō wa ame datta. = It was rainy yesterday
  = は (wa) follows the topic the speaker wants to talk about. Therefore, wa（は）is often called topic marking particle. The “topic” is often the grammatical 
  subject, but can be anything (including the grammatical object, and sometimes the verb), and it may also follow some other particles.

を (o) = Noun + o (を) + verb = 私はチョコを食べます。 = Watashi wa choko o tabemasu. = I eat chocolate.
  を (o) marks the grammatical object of a sentence. It follows nouns and noun phrases.

も (mo) = [Object1] は [property1/action1] です = [Object2] も [property1/action1] です. = 
A: 私はフランス人です。  = Watashi wa furansujin desu. = I am French. = B: 私もフランス人です。 = Watashi mo furansujin desu. = I am also French.
  も (mo) functions as “also” or “too” in English. It is used to indicate that something which has previously 
  been stated also holds true for the item currently under discussion.It replaces ga, wa or o when used.

に (ni) = place + ni (に) = 学校に行きます。 = Gakkō ni ikimasu. = I go to school.
  に (ni) indicates a place towards which someone or something moves. It is preceded by the name of the place and followed by a verb that indicates a moving action such 
  as iku (行く) “to go.” 
  It is also used with giving/receiving verbs and can then mean “from”.
  In the case of passive verbs, it marks the grammatical agent, making it the same as “by” in English. (i.e. “my wallet was stolen by my brother.” ).
  に is also used to indicate the location of existence when combined with the verbs いる or ある, making it the Japanese version of “at” (in some instances).

へ (e) = location/direction + e(へ) = 彼へ 手紙を送りました。 = Kare e tegami o okurimasita. = I sent him a letter.
  へ (e) is basically the same as に, except it emphasizes direction over arrival. The main difference is usage. へ is never used as “from”, “by”, “at”.
  In addition, the particle の can follow the へ particle directly, whereas it cannot follow に.

で (de) = location + de (で) = 私は家で 本を読みます。 =  Watashi wa ie de hon o yomimasu. = I read books at home.
  で (de) is used to indicate the location of an action. The performer of the action (the subject) is followed by either of the particles wa or ga, and the place is 
  followed by de. However, it can’t be used with with the verbs いる or ある.

が (ga) = だれ が 来ますか。 = Dare ga kimasu ka. = Who will come?
  が (ga) marks the grammatical subject of a sentence when it is first introduced to a conversation. It can also be used to join sentences, 
  like the word “but,” though that が is technically a different word. The particle が can also be used to emphasize the subject or distinguish it from others. 
  While は is used when a question word (who, where, etc.) comes after the topic in the sentence (レストランはどこですか。), we use the particle が when the question word 
  is the subject or part of it.

から (kara) = Noun + kara (から) = 学校から 家までどれくらいかかりますか。 = Gakkō kara ie made dorekurai kakarimasu ka? = How long does it take you to get home from school?
  から (kara) indicates the source of an object or action. This starting position may be either a point in space (in which case it is translated as “from”), or a point in
  time (in which case it is translated as “since” or “after”).

まで (made) = Noun + made (まで) = 彼女と７時まで ドライブしました。 = Kanojo to shichi-ji made doraibu shimashita. = I went driving around with my girlfriend until 7 o’clock.
  まで (made) indicates that an action/effect extends or reaches a specified limit or a point in time or space. It is therefore equivalent to the English “until.”

と (to) = Noun + to (と) + Noun = 肉と 魚が好きです。 = Niku to sakana ga suki desu. = I like meat and fish.
  と (to) is used to join nouns together into an exhaustive list that functions as a single noun: ”with,” “and.” It’s also the particle used to indicate a direct quote 
  (from someone’s mind or speech), functioning like quotation marks in English.

や (ya) = AやB AやBや = 赤や 黄色の花が咲いていた。 = Aka ya kīro no hana ga saiteita. = There were red, yellow, and other color flowers blooming.
  や (ya) is used in the same way as the first sense of と, but the list is not exhaustive. It means “such things as A, B, and C.”

の (no) = Object1 + の + Object2 = あなた の 名前はなんですか。 = Anata no namae wa nan desuka? = What’s your name?
  の (no) indicates possession (functioning like the English “apostrophe-S”). In the structure A no B, B belongs to A, however, many nouns act like adjectives when 
  followed by no. It directly follows nouns and noun phrases.

ね (ne) = End of the sentence + ne (ね) = これは美味しいです ね 。 = Kore wa oishii desu ne . = This is delicious, isn’t it?
  ね (ne) is used at the end of sentences, basically in the same way as an English tag question. If said with rising intonation, it indicates a request for confirmation
  from the listener (i.e., “It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it?” ), whereas if said with falling intonation, it’s used as a rhetorical device (i.e.,
  “It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it.” )

よ (yo) = End of the sentence + yo (よ) = 明日私は行く よ 。 = Ashita Watashi wa iku yo . = I’ll go tomorrow!
  よ (yo) is used by the speaker to express a strong conviction about something or to emphatically declare something.
