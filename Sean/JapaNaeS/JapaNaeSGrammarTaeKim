1-5: Intro========================================================================================================================
Step 1) Learn Hiragana/Katakana-Avoid Romaji-Each hiragana character has only one sound=phonetic
  Pay attention to additional sounds, especially long vowels, don't worry about perfecting it right away
  2)Learn Vocabulary-Learn words with Kanji-don't learn "kanji' by themselves, use an electronic dictionary-learn kanji gradually as you expand your vocabulary
  3)Learn Grammar-IGNORE english grammatical concepts such as sentence order or subject-avoid translating whole sentences
  4)Apply your knowledge-in real life situations with speaking and listening-copy native speakers for good inputs = good outputs
    Refine your knowledge-ask for corrections(most japanese are too polite to correct you), both positive and negative feedback is important
  5)Repeat steps-learning japanese is an iterative process-integrate listening and speaking japanese into your daily life-make it enjoyable
The translations might not have a subject because Japanese does not require one.
 the articles "the" and "a" do not exist in Japanese,
Japanese does not distinguish between a future action and a general statement (such as "I will go to the store" vs. "I go to the store")
「」These are the Japanese version of quotation marks
In Japanese, the most fundamental grammatical concepts are often the most difficult to truly understand. This means that the hardest part of the language will come first
if you cover them in the beginning, the easier parts will be all that much easier because they'll fit nicely on top of the foundation you have built.
Japanese is syntactically much more consistent than English. If you learn the hardest conjugation rules,
  The only difficult part from there on is sorting out and remembering all the various expressions and combinations in order to use them in the correct situations
Here's my advice for practicing Japanese: if you find yourself trying to figure out how to say an English thought in Japanese, save yourself the trouble and
  stop because you won't get it right most of the time. 
if you don't know how to say it already, then you don't know how to say it. Instead, if you can, ask someone how to say it in Japanese including a full explanation of the 
  answer and start practicing from Japanese.
 Practicing listening and speaking skills with fluent speakers of Japanese is a must if you wish to master conversational skills.
