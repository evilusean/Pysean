1-5: Intro========================================================================================================================
Step 1) Learn Hiragana/Katakana-Avoid Romaji-Each hiragana character has only one sound=phonetic
  Pay attention to additional sounds, especially long vowels, don't worry about perfecting it right away
  2)Learn Vocabulary-Learn words with Kanji-don't learn "kanji' by themselves, use an electronic dictionary-learn kanji gradually as you expand your vocabulary
  3)Learn Grammar-IGNORE english grammatical concepts such as sentence order or subject-avoid translating whole sentences
  4)Apply your knowledge-in real life situations with speaking and listening-copy native speakers for good inputs = good outputs
    Refine your knowledge-ask for corrections(most japanese are too polite to correct you), both positive and negative feedback is important
  5)Repeat steps-learning japanese is an iterative process-integrate listening and speaking japanese into your daily life-make it enjoyable
The translations might not have a subject because Japanese does not require one.
 the articles "the" and "a" do not exist in Japanese,
Japanese does not distinguish between a future action and a general statement (such as "I will go to the store" vs. "I go to the store")
「」These are the Japanese version of quotation marks
In Japanese, the most fundamental grammatical concepts are often the most difficult to truly understand. This means that the hardest part of the language will come first
if you cover them in the beginning, the easier parts will be all that much easier because they'll fit nicely on top of the foundation you have built.
Japanese is syntactically much more consistent than English. If you learn the hardest conjugation rules,
  The only difficult part from there on is sorting out and remembering all the various expressions and combinations in order to use them in the correct situations
Here's my advice for practicing Japanese: if you find yourself trying to figure out how to say an English thought in Japanese, save yourself the trouble and
  stop because you won't get it right most of the time. 
if you don't know how to say it already, then you don't know how to say it. Instead, if you can, ask someone how to say it in Japanese including a full explanation of the 
  answer and start practicing from Japanese.
 Practicing listening and speaking skills with fluent speakers of Japanese is a must if you wish to master conversational skills.

6/7: The Writing System-The Scripts/Intonation========================================================================================================================
Most of the words in the Japanese written language are written in Kanji (nouns, verbs, adjectives). 
There exists over 40,000 Kanji where about 2,000 represent over 95% of characters actually used in written text.
There are no spaces in Japanese so Kanji is necessary in distinguishing between separate words within a sentence.
Hiragana is used mainly for grammatical purposes. Words with extremely difficult or rare Kanji, colloquial expressions, and onomatopoeias are also written in Hiragana.
Kanji-you need to learn about 2,000 characters to reach an adult reading level
Japanese does not use spaces to seperate words
Intonation of high and low pitches is a crucial aspect of the spoken language.
The biggest obstacle for obtaining proper and natural sounding speech is incorrect intonation.
The only practical approach is to get the general sense of pitches by mimicking native Japanese speakers with careful listening and practice.

8-11: Hiragana-8 The Muddied Sounds9 The Small 「や」、「ゆ」、and 「よ」10 The Small 「つ」11 The Long Vowel Sound=========================================================
It is read up to down and right to left, which is how most Japanese books are written. 
In Japanese, writing the strokes in the correct order and direction is important, especially for Kanji
an old Japanese poem called 「いろは」 was often used as the base for ordering of Hiragana until recent times
The / r / or / l / sound in Japanese is quite different from any sound in English. It involves more of a roll and a clip by hitting the roof of your mouth with your tongue
Pay careful attention to the difference between / tsu / and / su /.
two tiny lines similar to a double quotation mark called dakuten (濁点)
a tiny circle called handakuten (半濁点) (technically called a voiced consonant or 「濁り」, which literally means to become muddy).
You can also combine a consonant with a / ya / yu / yo / sound by attaching a small 「や」、「ゆ」、or 「よ」 to the / i / vowel character of each consonant.
A small 「つ」 is inserted between two characters to carry the consonant sound of the second character to the end of the first.
The Long Vowel Sound-You can extend the vowel sound of a character by adding either 「あ」、「い」、or 「う」
/a/ a, ka, sa, etc + あ = long vowel
/i/ i, shi, ji, e, + い(or e)
/e/ + い(or e)
/u/ u, ku, kyu + う
/o/ + う(or o)
When pronouncing long vowel sounds, try to remember that they are really two sounds merged together.
MGS vs La Li Lu Le Lo removed, don't need to study handukuten

12-14: Katakana- 12 The Long Vowel Sound 13 The Small 「ア、イ、ウ、エ、オ」14 Some examples of words in Katakana==========================================================
Katakana is mainly used for words imported from foreign languages. It can also be used to emphasize certain words similar to the function of italics. 
Katakana represents the same set of phonetic sounds as Hiragana except all the characters are different.
it is better to completely forget the original English word, and treat the word as an entirely separate Japanese word
Katakana is significantly tougher to master compared to Hiragana because it is only used for certain words and you don’t get nearly as much practice
Japanese doesn't have any spaces, sometimes the symbol 「・」 is used to show the spaces
を」 is only ever used as a particle and all particles are in Hiragana.
The four characters 「シ」、「ン」、「ツ」、and 「ソ」 are fiendishly similar to each other.
  Basically, the difference is that the first two are more "horizontal" than the second two.
ノ」、「メ」、and 「ヌ」
フ」、「ワ」、 and 「ウ」
Long vowel sounds are written with a '-' dash for all vowel sounds
'v' sound is almost always pronounced as 'b' in japanese 

15-18: Kanji-15 What is Kanji? 16 Learning Kanji 17 Reading Kanji 18 Why Kanji?================================================================================
Chinese Characters adapted for Japanese
Most words are written in Kanji 
Learning Kanji early on speeds up learning new words
Learn Kanji with vocabulary, not by themselves
rule of thumb: when a word only uses one kanji, it is read with kunyomi(japanese), if it has multiple kanji(compound) it is read in onyomi(chinese)
stroke order is important, you should practice writing each new kanji on a piece of paper
In Japanese, nouns and stems of adjectives and verbs are almost all written in Chinese characters called Kanji. Adverbs are also fairly frequently written in Kanji as 
  well. This means that you will need to learn Chinese characters to be able to read most of the words in the language.
memorizing Kanji past short-term memory must be done with a great deal of study
I don't mean studying five hours a day but rather reviewing how to write a Kanji once every several months
you will want to repeatedly write out each Kanji to memorize the stroke order
 Another important skill is learning how to balance the character so that certain parts are not too big or small
Almost every character has two different readings called 音読み (おんよみ) and 訓読み (くんよみ) . 音読み is the original Chinese reading while 訓読み is the Japanese reading.
Certain characters (especially the most common ones) can have more than one 音読み or 訓読み.
Certain compound words also have special readings that have nothing to do with the readings of the individual characters. These readings must be individually memorized.
words often have a string of kana (called okurigana) that come attached to the word. This is so that the reading of the Chinese character stays the same even when 
  the word is conjugated to different forms.
 words that practically mean the same thing and use the same reading but have different Kanji to make just a slight difference in meaning. 
  For example 「聞く」 (きく) means to listen and so does 「聴く」 (きく)
  listening to music almost always prefers 「聴く」 over 「聞く」. 「聞く」 can also mean 'to ask', as well as, "to hear" but 「訊く」 (きく) can only mean "to ask"
  「見る」 as 「観る」 when it applies to watching a show such as a movie.
  「書く」 (かく) which means "to write" while 描く (かく) means "to draw". 
one special character 々 that is really not a character. It simply indicates that the previous character is repeated. 
  For example, 「時時」 、「様様」、「色色」、「一一」 can and usually are written as 「時々」、「様々」、「色々」、「一々」.

Basic Grammatical Structures 19-22: Expressing state-of-being ========================================================================================================
+19 ~だ = Da = Is, Declaring something is so and so using ~だ = Da vs Desu
+20 ~じゃない = Janai = Is Not, Conjugating to the negative state-of-being 
+21 ~だった = Daatta = Was, Conjugating to the past state-of-being 
+22 ~じゃなかった = JaNaKaata = Was Not, Conjugation summary
~だった or かった = datta or katta = was
  datta is used with noun. ex) -he was my friend. (watashi no tomodachi datta) -it was rain yesterday. (ame datta) katta is used with adjective ex) -it was cold.
+there is no verb for the state-of-being like the verb "to be" in English. You can declare what something is by attaching the「だ」 to a noun or な-adjective only. 
+A state-of-being can be implied without using 「だ」! through context
In Japanese, negative and past tense are all expressed by conjugation.
+We can conjugate a noun or adjective to either its negative or past tense to say that something is not [X] or that something was [X].
+, for the negative, attach 「じゃない」 to the noun or な-adjective.
+past tense of the state-of-being. To say something was something, attach 「だった」 to the noun or な-adjective.
+In order to say the negative past (was not), conjugate the negative to the negative past tense by dropping the 「い」 from 「じゃない」 and adding 「かった」.

23-26: Introduction to Particles 23 Defining grammatical functions with particles は= ha, も = mo, が = ga=============================================================
24 The 「は」= ha, topic particle 
associating a noun with another noun. This is done with something called particles. Particles are one or more Hiragana characters that attach to the end of a word to
  define the grammatical function of that word in the sentence. 
the meaning of a sentence can completely change just by changing the particles. For example, the sentence "Eat fish." can become "The fish eats."
は = ha(wa) = The topic particle will allow us to express what our sentences are about. 
   this character is normally pronounced as /ha/, it is pronounced /wa/ only when it is being used as the topic particle.
25 The「も」= mo, inclusive topic particle
the inclusive topic particle. It is essentially the topic particle with the additional meaning of "also". 
Basically, it can introduce another topic in addition to the current topic. 
The inclusion of 「も」 must be consistent with the answer.
26 The 「が」 = ga, identifier particle
It is also referred to as the subject particle but I hate that name since "subject" means something completely different in English grammar.
Instead, I call it the identifier particle because the particle indicates that the speaker wants to identify something unspecified.
The two particles 「は」 and 「が」 may seem very similar only because it is impossible to translate them directly into English. 
  I often translate the topic particle as "as for; about" and the identifier particle as "the one; the thing"
You can also think about the 「が」 particle as always answering a silent question.

27-30: Adjectives: な-adjective い-adjective================================================================================================================
Japanese doesn't make a distinction between singular or plural
27 Properties of Adjectives
28 The な-adjective
na(な) adjectives don't have a specific ending so the can also end in I (い)
な-adjective can directly modify a noun following it by sticking 「な」 between the adjective and noun. (Hence the name, な-adjective.)
when modifying a noun with a na adjective you must put it front of the noun and add a na = ~na noun
The な-adjective is very simple to learn because it acts essentially like a noun. All the conjugation rules for both nouns and な-adjectives are the same. 
You can also use adjectives with particles just like we did in the last lesson with nouns.
"like" is an adjective and not a verb in Japanese, you can think of 「好き」 as meaning "desirable"
29 The い-adjective
the I in I adjectives when looking at their kanji, the I must be in hiragna 
the whole point of the 「い」 in い-adjectives is to allow conjugation without changing the Kanji.
to modify a noun with an I adjecctive, simply place it right before the ~noun
Unlike な-adjectives, you do not need to add 「な」 to directly modify a noun with an い-adjective.
Remember how the negative state-of-being for nouns also ended in 「い」 (じゃない) ? Well, just like the negative state-of-being for nouns, 
  you can never attach the declarative 「だ」 to い-adjectives. Do NOT attach 「だ」 to い-adjectives.
Conjugation rules for い-adjectives:
Negative: First remove the trailing 「い」 from the い-adjective and then attach 「くない」
Example: 高い → 高くない
Past-tense: First remove the trailing 「い」 from the い-adjective or negative い-adjective and then attach 「かった」 Examples
1. 高い → 高かった
2. 高くない → 高くなかった
30 An annoying exception
There is one い-adjective meaning "good" that acts slightly differently from all other い-adjectives. 
This is a classic case of how learning Japanese is harder for beginners because the most common and useful words also have the most exceptions. 
The word for "good" was originally 「よい (良い) 」. However, with time, it soon became 「いい」
it is written in Kanji, it is usually read as 「よい」 so 「いい」 is almost always Hiragana.
all the conjugations are still derived from 「よい」
Another adjective that acts like this is 「かっこいい」 because it is an abbreviated version of two words merged together: 
  「格好」 and 「いい」. Since it uses the same 「いい」, you need to use the same conjugations.


31-33: Verb Basics る-verbs and う-verbs, いる/える う-verbs ===========================================================================================================
31 Role of Verbs
express actions. This is where verbs come in. Verbs, in Japanese, always come at the end of clauses. any sentence with a verb must end with the verb. 
unlike English, the only thing you need to make a grammatically complete sentence is a verb and nothing else!
32 Classifying verbs into る-verbs and う-verbs
All る-verbs end in 「る」
 う-verbs can end in a number of u-vowel sounds including 「る」. Therefore, if a verb does not end in 「る」, it will always be an う-verb.
or verbs ending in 「る」, if the vowel sound preceding the 「る」 is an /a/, /u/ or /o/ vowel sound, it will always be an う-verb. Otherwise, 
if the preceding sound is an /i/ or /e/ vowel sound, it will be a る-verb in most cases.
33 Appendix: いる/える う-verbs

34-35: Negative Verbs===============================================================================================================================================
34 Negative Verbs
 we want to say that such-and-such action was not performed.
This is done by conjugating the verb to the negative form just like the state-of-being for nouns and adjectives.
35 Conjugating verbs into the negative
ある (う-verb) – to exist (inanimate)
いる (る-verb) – to exist (animate)
「ある」 is an う-verb used to express existence of inanimate objects.
The equivalent verb for animate objects (such as people or animals) is 「いる」, which is a normal る-verb. 
These two verbs 「ある」 and 「いる」 are quite different from all other verbs because they describe existence and are not actual actions.
Conjugation rules for negative verbs:
  For る-verbs: Drop the 「る」 and attach 「ない」
  Example: 食べる + ない = 食べない
＊For う-verbs that end in 「う」: Replace 「う」 with 「わ」 and attach 「ない」
  Example: 買う + わ + ない = 買わない
  For all other う-verbs: Replace the u-vowel sound with the a-vowel equivalent and attach 「ない」
  Example: 待つ + た = 待たない
  Exceptions:
  1. する → しない
  2. くる → こない
  3. ＊ある → ない
