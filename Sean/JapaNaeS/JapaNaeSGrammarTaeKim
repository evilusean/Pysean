1-5: Intro========================================================================================================================
Step 1) Learn Hiragana/Katakana-Avoid Romaji-Each hiragana character has only one sound=phonetic
  Pay attention to additional sounds, especially long vowels, don't worry about perfecting it right away
  2)Learn Vocabulary-Learn words with Kanji-don't learn "kanji' by themselves, use an electronic dictionary-learn kanji gradually as you expand your vocabulary
  3)Learn Grammar-IGNORE english grammatical concepts such as sentence order or subject-avoid translating whole sentences
  4)Apply your knowledge-in real life situations with speaking and listening-copy native speakers for good inputs = good outputs
    Refine your knowledge-ask for corrections(most japanese are too polite to correct you), both positive and negative feedback is important
  5)Repeat steps-learning japanese is an iterative process-integrate listening and speaking japanese into your daily life-make it enjoyable
The translations might not have a subject because Japanese does not require one.
 the articles "the" and "a" do not exist in Japanese,
Japanese does not distinguish between a future action and a general statement (such as "I will go to the store" vs. "I go to the store")
「」These are the Japanese version of quotation marks
In Japanese, the most fundamental grammatical concepts are often the most difficult to truly understand. This means that the hardest part of the language will come first
if you cover them in the beginning, the easier parts will be all that much easier because they'll fit nicely on top of the foundation you have built.
Japanese is syntactically much more consistent than English. If you learn the hardest conjugation rules,
  The only difficult part from there on is sorting out and remembering all the various expressions and combinations in order to use them in the correct situations
Here's my advice for practicing Japanese: if you find yourself trying to figure out how to say an English thought in Japanese, save yourself the trouble and
  stop because you won't get it right most of the time. 
if you don't know how to say it already, then you don't know how to say it. Instead, if you can, ask someone how to say it in Japanese including a full explanation of the 
  answer and start practicing from Japanese.
 Practicing listening and speaking skills with fluent speakers of Japanese is a must if you wish to master conversational skills.

6/7: The Writing System-The Scripts/Intonation========================================================================================================================
Most of the words in the Japanese written language are written in Kanji (nouns, verbs, adjectives). 
There exists over 40,000 Kanji where about 2,000 represent over 95% of characters actually used in written text.
There are no spaces in Japanese so Kanji is necessary in distinguishing between separate words within a sentence.
Hiragana is used mainly for grammatical purposes. Words with extremely difficult or rare Kanji, colloquial expressions, and onomatopoeias are also written in Hiragana.
Kanji-you need to learn about 2,000 characters to reach an adult reading level
Japanese does not use spaces to seperate words
Intonation of high and low pitches is a crucial aspect of the spoken language.
The biggest obstacle for obtaining proper and natural sounding speech is incorrect intonation.
The only practical approach is to get the general sense of pitches by mimicking native Japanese speakers with careful listening and practice.

8-11: Hiragana-8 The Muddied Sounds9 The Small 「や」、「ゆ」、and 「よ」10 The Small 「つ」11 The Long Vowel Sound=========================================================
It is read up to down and right to left, which is how most Japanese books are written. 
In Japanese, writing the strokes in the correct order and direction is important, especially for Kanji
an old Japanese poem called 「いろは」 was often used as the base for ordering of Hiragana until recent times
The / r / or / l / sound in Japanese is quite different from any sound in English. It involves more of a roll and a clip by hitting the roof of your mouth with your tongue
Pay careful attention to the difference between / tsu / and / su /.
two tiny lines similar to a double quotation mark called dakuten (濁点)
a tiny circle called handakuten (半濁点) (technically called a voiced consonant or 「濁り」, which literally means to become muddy).
You can also combine a consonant with a / ya / yu / yo / sound by attaching a small 「や」、「ゆ」、or 「よ」 to the / i / vowel character of each consonant.
A small 「つ」 is inserted between two characters to carry the consonant sound of the second character to the end of the first.
The Long Vowel Sound-You can extend the vowel sound of a character by adding either 「あ」、「い」、or 「う」
/a/ a, ka, sa, etc + あ = long vowel
/i/ i, shi, ji, e, + い(or e)
/e/ + い(or e)
/u/ u, ku, kyu + う
/o/ + う(or o)
When pronouncing long vowel sounds, try to remember that they are really two sounds merged together.
