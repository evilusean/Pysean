A repo for creating a STT(Speech-To-Text) app that can take in an audio recording and return the Japanese text </br>
Goals and AspireASeans = I want the model to be able to listen to a Japanese audio(movie, podcast, interview, work meeting, etc) and be able to transcribe with timestamps an English transcription and a Japanese translation in a csv. </br>
Bonus Points/if I am feeling ambitious = If I can get it to do it live through a push-to-talk or run in background when capslock is down, that would be perfect, and transcribe/translate on the fly with timestamps for later review. </br>
