#this is the prompt I'm going to use with Claude, if it doesn't work, I'll try OpenAI

DockerFile :
I want to create a dockerfile that runs OpenAI's whisper model TTS for Japanese translation. It will need to have access to my host machines GPU. 
I will need to install all dependancies, and use an appropriate python version for the Whisper Model - 
I want to be able to use it from the command line so a command like 'docker whisper container start record' and 'docker whisper container stop record' and 
then translate the saved recording after transcribing the japanese to a text file, I will want time stamps, romaji, hiragana, and the english translation - you can worry about the code later, 
right now I just want all of the files and dependancies installed for accomplishing that task in the 'dockerfile' 
the dependancies I can think of would be python 3.9, ffmpeg, pip, torch, torchaudio, cuda, openai-whisper, and add on any others you will think I need to the dockerfile for transcribing and translating
again, make sure all the dependancies are the right version, as python will be downgraded to run openAI's whisper model for Japanese,
ensure I have the correct docker image pulled initially from dockerhub
ensure that the dockerfile can use my host machine graphics card for cuda, I don't know how to set this up, please let me know.
also let me know if there is anything I need to install on my host machine outside of the dockerfile and container, I would also like the container to read code outside of the container
so I can develop easier, and simply change code on my host machine that will then be able to be read in the docker container without rebuilding, by creating a volume that is also accessible by the container
Also, create for me a '.gitignore' file and a '.dockerignore' file so that I don't upload anything outside of the volume code I'm using to develop to github
