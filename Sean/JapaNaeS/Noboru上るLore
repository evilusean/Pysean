Deep lore on '上' (one of like 10 different ways to say 'up' in Japanese - with the same kanji/character - you just know from context, bro) :
The verb 上る is read as noboru, because the Japanese language already had a word meaning "to climb" or "to ascend" (noboru) before the introduction of a writing system.
When they adopted Chinese characters (kanji), they borrowed the character 上, which carries the general meaning of "up," to represent this concept in writing.

Interestingly, noboru can also be written with other kanji, such as 登る and 昇る, depending on the specific nuance or context of the action. For example:

上る is often used for going up stairs or a slope.
登る is more common for climbing mountains or ladders.
昇る is typically used for natural phenomena like the sun rising.

The choice of kanji often reflects subtle differences in usage or connotation, but in many cases, multiple forms can be acceptable.
