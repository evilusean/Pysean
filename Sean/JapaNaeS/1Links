JPDB - Actually really good, it has cross deck completion, so if I complete a word in another deck, it will remember I've learned it, similar to wanikani(same method for kanji), but free.
 another thing that's super useful, is it is stored on a server, so if I wipe my main SSD(again), I don't have to start the anki deck over(again, I've restarted twice now, wasting weeks) :
 another another thing thats super nice, it doesn't cut you off, after you finish your 20 new cards and reviews for the day, anki and wanikani will stop giving you new cards - you can no life it
 can search any japanese anime/live action show/movie/book - and it has all the vocab you need to know, pretty useful, almost all cards have audio as a word, and in a sentence

If (When) I move to Japan, 1 of 2 things happens: 1) I'm happy there and fit in with the culture and people 2) My Idealized romanticized visean I've built up is shattered, and I need to try somewhere else (not canada, lol, lmao)

AspireASeans(AKA Escaping gynocentric geriatric molochian marxist ponzischeme propagandized rentseeking parasite infested sh!thole failed state known as canada):
^couldn't fit all the adjectives needed to describe how bad this '"country"' is^ >Half of income stolen in taxes, >half of what remains for rent, "privileged" lollmao
Affordable Housing, Low Taxes, Good Wages, Good People, High IQ, Thin, non-captured leadership that doesn't hate their own people=Japan has everything Vs canada
IT Vs Internship Vs English Teacher Vs Student Vs Language School Vs Bootcamp(le wagon) -> Investment Visa
Get to Japan on working visa -> Work, save money in big city -> Buy appartment in big city -> get akiya(free house) in countryside -> work remotely on homestead
"You must invest more 5 million yen as initial investment OR hire 2 employees (Japanese nationals or foreign nationals with relevant visa status)."
That equals $35k capital OR hiring fellow Anons and Japanese to restore the community, as long as they are on the payroll the requirements are met
"Need representation of a physical office" Turn part of your fixer upper home into an office or you can get a physical office for under $800. 
You need a business address separate from your domicile address, so your first option is not workable. It doesn't need to be a physical office though, 
so you can rent a PO box office space called a virtual office in Japan for under 100 dollars a month. <= start this after arriving, create LLC "TechniSean", profit
Godo Kaisha(form an entity)+Co sign With a local director(office address+current resident), get a bilingual lawyer, he creates, then resigns, 
  , I get an LLC to buy either property or start a business, get an LLC bank account
Can do the same plan in Italy/Hungary/Romania/etc, Many Opseans
