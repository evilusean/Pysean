^couldn't fit all the adjectives needed to describe how bad this '"country"' is^ >Half of income stolen in taxes, >half of what remains for rent, "privileged" lollmao
Affordable Housing, Low Taxes, Good Wages, Good People, High IQ, Thin, non-captured leadership that doesn't hate their own people=Japan has everything Vs canada
IT Vs Internship Vs English Teacher Vs Student -> Investment Visa
Get to Japan on working visa -> Work, save money in big city -> Buy appartment in big city -> get akiya(free house) in countryside -> work remotely on homestead
"You must invest more 5 million yen as initial investment OR hire 2 employees (Japanese nationals or foreign nationals with relevant visa status)."
That equals $35k capital OR hiring fellow Anons and Japanese to restore the community, as long as they are on the payroll the requirements are met
"Need representation of a physical office" Turn part of your fixer upper home into an office or you can get a physical office for under $800. 
You need a business address separate from your domicile address, so your first option is not workable. It doesn't need to be a physical office though, 
so you can rent a PO box office space called a virtual office in Japan for under 100 dollars a month. <= start this after arriving, create LLC "TechniSean", profit
Can do the same plan in Italy/Hungary/Romania/etc, Many Opseans
