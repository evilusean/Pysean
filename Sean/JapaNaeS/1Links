JPDB - Actually really good, it has cross deck completion, so if I complete a word in another deck, it will remember I've learned it, similar to wanikani(same method for kanji), but free.
 another thing that's super useful, is it is stored on a server, so if I wipe my main SSD(again), I don't have to start the anki deck over(again, I've restarted twice now, wasting weeks) :
 another another thing thats super nice, it doesn't cut you off, after you finish your 20 new cards and reviews for the day, anki and wanikani will stop giving you new cards - you can no life it
 can search any japanese anime/live action show/movie/book - and it has all the vocab you need to know, pretty useful, almost all cards have audio as a word, and in a sentence

The Plaza Accord was an agreement signed in 1985 by five major economies—the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, and the United Kingdom—at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. 
Its main goal was to devalue the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen and the German Deutsche Mark, in order to correct massive U.S. trade deficits.
Summary of the Plaza Accord and Its Effect on Japan:
1. Purpose of the Accord:
In the early 1980s, the U.S. dollar was extremely strong.
This made American exports expensive and imports cheap, worsening the U.S. trade deficit.
The U.S. pressured its allies to help reduce the dollar's value through coordinated currency intervention.
2. Impact on Japan:
The Japanese yen appreciated sharply after the accord (from around ¥240/USD to under ¥120/USD by the end of the decade).
This made Japanese exports more expensive and less competitive.
Japan, heavily dependent on exports, was hit hard and responded with massive monetary easing (low interest rates and credit expansion).
3. Asset Bubble and Economic Crash:
Easy money in Japan led to a huge real estate and stock market bubble in the late 1980s.
The bubble burst in the early 1990s, triggering the "Lost Decade"—a period of prolonged economic stagnation.
Japan never fully regained its 1980s trajectory as a challenger to U.S. economic dominance.
4. Neutralizing Japan as an Economic Rival:
Many economists and critics argue that the Plaza Accord indirectly “neutered” Japan as a rising economic superpower.
By forcing Japan to revalue its currency and later suffer a financial crisis, the U.S. blunted what had been a strong challenge to its global economic leadership.

That equals $35k capital OR hiring fellow Anons and Japanese to restore the community, as long as they are on the payroll the requirements are met
"Need representation of a physical office" Turn part of your fixer upper home into an office or you can get a physical office for under $800. 
You need a business address separate from your domicile address, so your first option is not workable. It doesn't need to be a physical office though, 
so you can rent a PO box office space called a virtual office in Japan for under 100 dollars a month. <= start this after arriving, create LLC "TechniSean", profit
