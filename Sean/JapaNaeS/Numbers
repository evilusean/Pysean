4, 7 and 9 all have two possible readings. In times past, the Japanese created the preferable alternatives, yon, nana, and kyu, because of superstition
around the sounds shi, shichi and ku (which can mean “death”, “place of death” and “agony”).
after 10, only those preferred pronunciations – yon, nana and kyu – are used for 4, 7 and . So for double-digit numbers ending in a 0, like 40, 
we usually say _yonjuu and not shi juu.

The biggest difference is that the big numbers are divided by units of 4 (or 10,000) rather than 3 (1,000). So once you get past 10,000, it can be a bit confusing to 
  think of one million as “one hundred ten-thousands” at first.
The other thing to take note of is that some numbers conjugate differently with certain counters. The ones to look out for are 1, 3, 6, and 8.
三分 (sanpun, “three minutes”)
六 (6) changes the “h” kana to “pp,” like 六匹 (roppiki, “six animals”).
八 (8) changes “h” counters the same as 6, usually. 
hen counting people in Japanese, you use the counter ~人 (nin) for 3 or more people.

For one person, you say ひとり (hitori), and for two people you say ふたり (futari). Any number after that is the Sino-Japanese number system followed by ~人, 
  such as 三人 (sannin, “three people”).
  
For long, thin objects, like pens, chopsticks, or bottles, the counter is ~本 (hon).
四本のペン (yon hon no pen, “four pens”).

Although 本 means “book” in Japanese, it isn’t the counter for books (that’s ~冊, satsu, which is the counter for bound objects, like manga).

~本 is also the counter for things like roads, rivers, and train tracks – anything that travels that is very long and thin. 
  It’s also used for long-distance telephone calls and travel routes.
  
Used for small objects, connect ~個 (ko) to the number to count it. And it’s also used for round objects, like apples: リンゴ二個 (ringo niko, ‘two apples”).

When counting small animals, you use ~匹 (hiki), like dogs and cats.
For larger animals, like horses or elephants, you use ~頭 (tou).
For example, 三匹の犬 (sanbiki no inu, “three dogs” – also note the change from h to b in hiki) and 三頭の馬 (santou no uma, “three horses”).

Yes, even cars, your washer and dryer, and your video game console for playing games in Japanese have their own counter. Bicycles fall under this category, too.
You use ~台 (dai) for these objects, like 二台の車 (nidai no kuruma, “two cars”).

To express time in Japanese, you’ve guessed it, you use counters! You express seconds with ~秒 (byou), minutes with ~分 (fun or pun), hours with ~時 (ji), and length
of time with ~時間 (jikan).
For months, you use ~月 (getsu), and for years you use ~年 (nen).

Other counters you’ll stumble across often are ~枚 (mai), ~回 (kai), and ~階 (kai or gai).

~枚 is used to count flat objects, like paper. ~回 is used to express the number of times, like the number of times in a week you workout.
  ~階 is used to count the number of floors in a building.

In Japanese, numbers can come before or after the item being counted.
But they typically come after the item + particle, such as はがきを五枚買います (Hagaki wo gomai kaimasu, “I will buy 5 postcards”). はがき (item counted) を (particle) 五枚 
  (number + counter) 買います (verb).
If you put the number before the item, then it needs の (no) to connect them.
Reversing the last sentence, 五枚のはがきを買います (Gomai no hagaki wo kaimasu) means the same thing but puts the emphasis on the quantity. It’s usually said this way in 
  response to a question (like “How many did you buy?”).

Japanese Ordinal Numbers:
Japanese ordinal numbers express order or sequence, like first, second, and third.
In Japanese, you add 第~ (dai) before the number.
So first is 第一 (dai ichi)、第二 (dai ni), and so on.
For numbers with counters that you’re giving in a sequence, you add ~目 (me). So “for the first time” is 一回目 (ikkai me). “Third person” is 三人目 (sannin me).

To say “number” in Japanese, you can say 数 (kazu) to express a number as quantity, or 数字 (suuji) as in figures or cardinal numbers. “To count” is 数える (kazoeru).
If you need to express yourself in mathematical terms, here are some words you can use:
Plus: プラス (purasu) or 足す (tasu) Minus: マイナス (mainasu) Equals: は (wa) Multiply: 掛ける (kakeru) Divide: 割る (waru) Half: 半分 (hanbun) Point: 点 (ten)

Saying Japanese phone numbers out loud is pretty straightforward. You always read the numbers as single digits, then you say “の” (no) wherever the dash is.
So the number 123-456-7890 would be いち に さん の よん ご ろく の なな はち きゅう まる(ichi ni san no yon go roku no nana hachi kyuu maru).
