三毒 = San-doku = The Japanese term for the "Three Poisons" or "three roots of evil." This collective term refers to the three primary mental afflictions (greed, anger, and ignorance) that are the root causes of suffering (dukkha) and rebirth within Buddhist cosmology.
貪 = Ton = Greed (or attachment, craving, desire, lust). This poison involves clinging to pleasant experiences, objects, or people in an insatiable manner, leading to a constant state of dissatisfaction and suffering. It is often expanded as 貪欲 (tonyoku).  It is represented by a Rooster (鶏, niwatori), symbolizing how a rooster pecks relentlessly at the ground for food.
瞋 = Jin = Anger (or hatred, aversion, ill will). This poison is the active rejection of anything unpleasant or disagreeable, the desire to push away negative feelings, situations, or people, often manifesting as hostility, rage, or resentment. It is often expanded as 瞋恚 (shinni). It is represented by a Snake (蛇, hebi), symbolizing how a snake is quick to strike with venom.
癡 = Chi = Ignorance (or delusion, confusion, stupidity). Considered the fundamental poison from which the other two arise. It represents a deep-seated lack of wisdom (avidyā), specifically the failure to understand the true nature of reality, impermanence, and the interconnectedness of all phenomena. It is often expanded as 愚癡 (guchi) or sometimes referred to as 無明 (mumyō, meaning "no light" or "darkness"). It is represented by a Pig (豚, buta or 猪, inoshishi), symbolizing dullness and apathy.
