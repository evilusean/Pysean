=================================================================================================================================Writing Systems and Pronunciation:
  -Chapter Overview, -Hiragana, -Katakana, -Additional Sounds, -Kanji, -Basic numbers and age, -Chapter summary and practice
 Japanese pronunciation is based on alterations between a high and low pitch. The biggest obstacle for obtaining proper and natural sounding speech is incorrect intonation.
When learning Kanji, it is very important to learn it with the proper stroke order and direction from the beginning in order to avoid developing any bad habits.
Kanji: The simpler characters called radicals are often reused as components in larger characters. Once you learn the radical stroke order and 
  get used to the patterns, you’ll find that it’s not difficult to figure out the correct stroke order for most Kanji.
One good general rule of thumb is that strokes usually start from the top-left corner toward the bottom-right. 
  This means that horizontal strokes are generally written from left to right and vertical strokes are written from top to bottom.
An effective strategy for mastering Kanji is learning them with new vocabulary within a larger context. 
  we can associate contextual information with the character in order to reinforce memory.
Generally, Kun-yomi is used for words that only use one character. 
Kun-yomi is also used for native Japanese words including most adjectives and verbs.
On-yomi, on the other hand, is mostly used for words that originate from Chinese, which often use 2 or more Kanji. 
on-yomi is often written in Katakana. 
 the more common characters such as 「人」 will generally have a lot more readings. 
With adjectives, the trailing Hiragana, called Okurigana are needed to perform various conjugations without affecting the Kanji.
Kanji is often used to make subtle distinctions or give a different shade of meaning for a word. In some cases, it is very important to remember to use the correct Kanji
  for the correct situation. For example, while the adjective for hot is 「あつい」, when used to describe the climate, you must write it as 「暑い」. 
  When you are describing a hot object or person, you must write it as 「熱い」 instead.

=================================================================================================================================Nouns and Adjectives:
-State of Being:
you should use the polite form when speaking to a teacher, a superior such as your boss, or people you’re not very familiar with.
For nouns and adjectives, all that is required for the polite form is to add 「です」 to the end of the sentence.
-Topic Paricles:
「は」The topic particle while written as 「は」, is pronounced 「わ
「も」 Inclusive Topic Particle = The 「も」 particle used the same way as 「は」 topic particle but adds the meaning of “as well” or “also”.
-Addressing People:
Anatta wa is NOT considered polite, there are no polite words for you in japanese, inferred through context or refer to them as name-san suffix
never use san to refer to yourself, you can also use kun suffix to refer to males, chan to refer to females, and sama as an honorific suffix
-Sentence-Ending Particles: 「よ」 and 「ね」
「ね」 is used when the speaker is seeking agreement and confirmation. It adds a tone similar to saying, “right?” or “isn’t it?”.
「よ」 is used when the speaker wants to point something out or make something aware to the listener. It adds a tone similar to saying, “you know?”.
The two can be used together as 「よね」
-Adjectives: 「い」. (I adjectives) and 「い」 (Na adjectives)
「い」. (I adjectives) always end in I 「い」
  Look at the word written in kanji the I in I adjectives is always written in hiragana- easy to tell 
Na adjectives don't always end in Na 「い」
  Na adjectives when written in kanji will not have an I at the end
Japanese does not make a distinction with singular and plural
「い」adjectives can modify a noun simply by placing it before the noun
「い」Adjectives can modify a noun by placing it before the noun and appending a na inbetween  = adjective + na + noun
Na adjectives are essentially nouns. They work like nouns. That is why they need “na”
I adjectives are close cousins of verbs. They conjugate like verbs. Na adjectives don’t because nouns don’t conjugate.
The “is” function is built into i adjectives. Kirei (na adjective) means “pretty” (or “prettiness”). 
  But utsukushii (i adjective) does not mean “beautiful”, it means “is beautiful”. 
Na is a form of da. “So that is why na adjectives need na! 
-Male/Female Speech:「だ」
Declarative 「だ」Da = attached to nouns and na-adjectives to give it a more declarative tone and make the state-of-being explicit
  Only attach 「だ」 to nouns and na-adjectives. Never to i-adjectives.
  For males, in particular, it is important to use it before 「ね」 or 「よ」 to avoid sounding too feminine.
-Noun Properties: 「の」
The 「の」 particle has many different uses but one of the most basic usages is for describing nouns with other nouns similar to how we described nouns with adjectives.
used to connect 2 or more nouns this is usually used to describe ownership, membership, property or any other description that involves another noun.
It is important to remember the order the modification takes place. noun1(supporting noun) no noun2(primary noun) or A(B(C)) or large to small or owner(A) of possesion(C)
If you’re unsure of the order, I recommend translating 「の」 as “of” and reading it in reverse. noun A no noun B no noun C = A's B's C or general to specific
The 「の」 particle can also replace the noun entirely when it’s understood by the context. 赤いのは、好き。= akai no wa suki = (I) like the red one.
KoSoADo words: Kou(like this, close to speaker) Vs Sou(like that, farther away) Vs Aa (like that, over there) Vs Dou(How)
  Koko = Here Vs Soko = There Vs Asoko = Over there Vs Doko = Where?
  Kore = This Vs Sore = That vs Are = That, over there Vs Dore = Which?
