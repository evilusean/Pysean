 Japanese pronunciation is based on alterations between a high and low pitch. The biggest obstacle for obtaining proper and natural sounding speech is incorrect intonation.
When learning Kanji, it is very important to learn it with the proper stroke order and direction from the beginning in order to avoid developing any bad habits.
Kanji: The simpler characters called radicals are often reused as components in larger characters. Once you learn the radical stroke order and 
  get used to the patterns, you’ll find that it’s not difficult to figure out the correct stroke order for most Kanji.
One good general rule of thumb is that strokes usually start from the top-left corner toward the bottom-right. 
  This means that horizontal strokes are generally written from left to right and vertical strokes are written from top to bottom.
An effective strategy for mastering Kanji is learning them with new vocabulary within a larger context. 
  we can associate contextual information with the character in order to reinforce memory.
Generally, Kun-yomi is used for words that only use one character. 
Kun-yomi is also used for native Japanese words including most adjectives and verbs.
On-yomi, on the other hand, is mostly used for words that originate from Chinese, which often use 2 or more Kanji. 
on-yomi is often written in Katakana. 
 the more common characters such as 「人」 will generally have a lot more readings. 
With adjectives, the trailing Hiragana, called Okurigana are needed to perform various conjugations without affecting the Kanji.
Kanji is often used to make subtle distinctions or give a different shade of meaning for a word. In some cases, it is very important to remember to use the correct Kanji
  for the correct situation. For example, while the adjective for hot is 「あつい」, when used to describe the climate, you must write it as 「暑い」. 
  When you are describing a hot object or person, you must write it as 「熱い」 instead.
