No MIDI Keyboard / mixer / audio input splitter / keyboard / polyend tracker / good headphones - should probably wait till I escape canada before picking up a gear intensive expensive hobby
If I have been eating tuna + rice for over 3 months daily- I can't afford this hobby- Treat others as they have treated you. Money for beer/dogs, not food. Taking care of the elderly is the governments job, would you like MAID service?
