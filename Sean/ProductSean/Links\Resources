Swanky Amp (really solid guitar amp sim)

Fire (multiband saturator),
VCV rack Euro rack simulator (cardinal for the free VST version),
adl-plug (old school OPL/midi synth),
sfizz and decent sampler (for SFZ and other sampled instruments)

many of the TAL plugins are Linux native now (TAL filter, reverb 4, chorus lx noisemaker and TAL sampler)
Nils kv1 (90s/2000s cheesy rompler keyboard emulation)
Stochas (midi sequencer plugin based on randomness and probability with scale snapping)
Fircomp
Soca Labs mverb (also lots of chip tune inspired plugins and some staples like delay, chorus, comp, etc there)

FruityLoops On Linux :
https://zizicaca.notion.site/How-to-run-FL-Studio-and-plugins-on-Linux-15db0918501842adb21e4614b8f234ec
The Trial Version only lets you save, not open, so after docker, I might try, create a docker container/VM and then keep FL studio open on that - or just use a linux based one - Reaper was pretty overwhelming
2024-12-14 : I tried to install FL-Studio through lutris, wouldn't work, debating whether to use a docker container or VM with Virtual box - Got it working, finally - added more cpus, and it installed properly
sudo pacman -Syu virtualbox virtualbox-host-modules-arch #installs virtualbox on arch linux, system update, need to reboot
sudo modprobe vboxdrv #load VirtualBox kernel modules, not found, just going to reboot
Download the ISO first, it doesn't work like docker with an image hub, working on that now
virtual box installed, search menu, 'new', windows 11(ptuh), ram = 8gigs, HD = 20gigs(next time, boost this to 25gigs, just installed FL studio, only 1 gig left), After that go to settings
 Settings : Under "Storage," click on the 'empty' optical drive and choose the Windows ISO you downloaded. -> 'Finish' -> Start VM -> Install Windows -> Download FL Studio -> Install 
 No internet on Installing Windows : Settings -> Network -> Bridged Adapater -> Promiscuous Mode 'Allow VMs" -> 'Cable Connected' = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk0K88ZkE34&t=123s&ab_channel=ACCAutomation
You can 'save state' before you shut down the VM, maybe keep the DAW in an open state so don't run out of trial version? - idk, still have to play around with it
