The project does not start inside of the editing program, 
Before starting a project, you need an idea, a storyboard/script, and gather your assets for the project.
Workspaces : To change your workspace, go into 'Editing'(Upper right hand corner) or 'Audio', 'Effects', 'Color' - changes the UI
  You can resize any panel by clicking the side of window and dragging
Tabs : You can edit your available tabs, 'View'(top dropdown), each tab will give you a new place to 'Compositions', 'Effects', 'Project Bin', etc
Settings : 
'Settings' -> 'Run Config Wizard' = Automatically detected my nvidia drivers, will need to 'prime-run kdenlive' so it autoselects GPU
'Ctl' + 'Alt' + ',' = Configure Keybindings, also has a search function
