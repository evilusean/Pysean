'yay -S davinci-resolve-studio' # install on arch linux with yay package manager, there is an aur, but it doesn't work for some reason - running crazy low on SSD space, but can fit this in for next project(s)
- I just realized, since I am already crushed for storage, downloading a bunch of high def videos probably isn't the greatest plan, I can still mess around till I 'Step 1) Escape canada' and then get a NAS for storage, I am not setting up an LLC or monetizeASean while I am in the ....(save myself a few minutes here, and not stringing together PEJORATIVES while talking about how bad this economic zone slave/open air prison colony is).... of canada - Decades of abuse. Not one apology. Return the Favor. F=-F.
- Hit my limit on SSD while installing DaVinci, going to reinstall Arch Linux(Again, btw). I installed a bunch of Docker/VM/ML/AI models and stuff that I don't need anymore(the TTS + translasean model was cool though) that take up crazy amounts of space, it's a pain to remove them and all their dependancies, without breaking something and having to reinstall anyways. I would rather clean it before I leave canada than while I am working full time - that's a lost weekend. Need to back up everything, then reinstall Arch OS tommorrow, next few days will just be installing all my stuff again, sans the bloat - keep it minimal - only what I need. Not downloading 20 gig models for one project or 5 gig instruments that don't work.
