##### What Reaper Does :
Free. Open Source. Based. >150MB DL. Works on Linux.
'sudo pacman -S reaper' That's it, no VM's, no docker containers, installed.
- CustomizeASean = Everything in Reaper can be customized : Themes(Options -> Theme adjuster for custom colours), Preferences, Menus, Mouse Modifiers(hot keys), toolbars, Actions(Macros), custom hotkeys/shortcuts, 
- Track lanes + comping = choose best parts to combine into a single file
- FX chains = a group of FX/settings that can be saved and reused later for other projects
- FX can be grouped in a container to be treated like one FX
- Only one track type 
- mouse placement for fades/trimming/volume/movement - intuitive instead of a modifier
- Pre Fader Envelopes - wave form editing
- you can copy multiple audio inputs between projects easily
- Track Folders = similar to a bus, route tracks from children to parent tracks, allows you to change multiple tracks as a single unit, hold 'SHIFT' to change just one - can 'hide/show' with arrow on top left
- Regions function = allows you to arrange songs/mixes
- Automation = copy faders and use them elsewhere in the song
- Gate/EQ/Compression/Reverb/Delay + Sequencer 'MegaBaby' allows you to play a keyboard with a step sequencer, click boxes to create [Arpeggios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio)
- Screen Sense = allows you to switch views with a hotkey
- Subprojects = I heard you like projects
- Render Qeue = Add to qeue, render later
