##### What Reaper Does :
Free. Open Source. Based. >150MB DL. Works on Linux.
'sudo pacman -S reaper' That's it, no VM's, no docker containers, installed.
- CustomizeASean = Everything in Reaper can be customized : Themes(Options -> Theme adjuster for custom colours), Preferences, Menus, Mouse Modifiers(hot keys), toolbars, Actions(Macros), custom hotkeys/shortcuts, 
- Track lanes + comping = choose best parts to combine into a single file
- FX chains = a group of FX/settings that can be saved and reused later for other projects
- FX can be grouped in a container to be treated like one FX
- Only one track type 
- mouse placement for fades/trimming/volume/movement - intuitive instead of a modifier
- Pre Fader Envelopes - wave form editing
- you can copy multiple audio inputs between projects easily
- Track Folders = similar to a bus, route tracks from children to parent tracks, allows you to change multiple tracks as a single unit, hold 'SHIFT' to change just one - can 'hide/show' with arrow on top left
- Regions function = allows you to arrange songs/mixes
- Automation = copy faders and use them elsewhere in the song
- Gate/EQ/Compression/Reverb/Delay + Sequencer 'MegaBaby' allows you to play a keyboard with a step sequencer, click boxes to create [Arpeggios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio)
- Screen Sense = allows you to switch views with a hotkey
- Subprojects = I heard you like projects
- Render Qeue = Add to qeue, render later

- After first install, change some settings, most of the defaults 
- 'View' in top dropdown to hide menus/objects - most have their own hotkeys
- 'Float' Mixer = right click -> 'Dock Mixer in Docker' -> unselect to float
- Create a track = 'double click' on the track control panel
- tracks by default have very little detail press 'O' (recored mode) to bring up the menu, You can change the input type from 'mono'/'stereo'/'MIDI' from the 'Triangle' dropdown on this menu
- To change the Default appearance of tracks = 'View' -> 'ScreenSets/Layouts' 'Layouts' Tab -> 'Track Panel' -> Change Size % and Layout (A vs B vs C) 'B' shows everything for tracks
- Project Sample Rate/BPM = By Default turned off - 'File' -> 'Project Settings' -> 'Project Sample Rate' (Hz) - All samples you import will stretch or shrink to match this tempo
-  'File' -> 'Project Settings' -> 'Media' Tab = Let's you change what filetype audio format is saved as 'Wav - 24bit' is default
- Reaper 7 has a new feature that every audio file/track you create will be saved in a relative file/subfolder of that project you saved = click 2 boxes when saving 'Create subdirectory for project' and 'Copy all media into project directory' - better for backups
