- Focus on the drum beat first = 4-4 kick drum by Avicii(RIP)/Deadmau5 most common - a kick on every 4 beats - inbetween those beats an open hat or a closed hat - and on every other kick(2nd and 4th kick) add a clap or snare
- Add a bassline = Long sustained bassline Vs Bass between kicks Vs Syncopated bass line = split into 1/16ths
- add Choords third
- get the beat in first before equalizers or compression - crawl - walk - run (Based. Lol, Lmao. bassed? bass'd?)
- Silence is an instrument 
- Get the Balance right(faders) - accentuate what the main part of the song is
