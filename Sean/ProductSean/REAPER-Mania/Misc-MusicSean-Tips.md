- pick a genre/artist/track you love - copy/recreate/replicate it - learn by doing what the best have already done - immitateSean is the most sincere form of flattery - use it as a template - learn the techniques - the skills you learn replicating a track can be taken and used for every other track you create

- Download high quality of tracks(not youtube) - Beatport - bring it into DAW - make sure project tempo matches tempo of song
- Trap BPM = 130-150 BPMs.
- Electrohouse BPM = 125–135 beats per minute
- Dubstep BPM = 132–142 beats per minute
- DNB/Drum and Bass BPM = between 160 and 180 beats per minute
- House BPM = 115–130

- Focus on the drum beat first = 4-4 kick drum by Avicii(RIP)/Deadmau5 most common - a kick on every 4 beats - inbetween those beats an open hat or a closed hat - and on every other kick(2nd and 4th kick) add a clap or snare
- Add a bassline = Long sustained bassline Vs Bass between kicks Vs Syncopated bass line = split into 1/16ths
- add Choords third
- get the beat in first before equalizers or compression - crawl - walk - run (Based. Lol, Lmao. bassed? bass'd?)
- Silence is an instrument 
- Get the Balance right(faders) - accentuate what the main part of the song is
- Audio Fatigue = same sound repeated creates fatigue in the listener
- Layer sounds - instead of just one kick drum, create 3 with slight differences, in pitch or tempo, different midi or wav files - you can use JS plugins/macros in Reaper to select every odd or even note and then change the velocity/pitch/length on each 
- Don't tune your kick - you autismo - 1/8 is a good size for decent soundsystems - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bzu8xNp5X4&ab_channel=SolState - this contradicts the last dude I listened to yesterday - who do you trust more? some dude on youtube or Deadmau5? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3rDduXys5I&ab_channel=SolState
- 'PsychoAcoustic' = Create the effect of something being larger than it is, without actually being large and dominating the low frequencies - Assert Dominance through Reverb before on the kicks, then as bassline hits, shorten the kick so you have more room on the lower frequenSeans to play with - Pre-prep the mind - Sir? are the kicks in the room with us right now? Most kicks will bounce around the room, on walls, etc, so a 1/8 note can turn into a 1/4
- Create/select sounds first, then create the song, so you aren't busy making sounds in the middle of a mix, here are the ingredients(instruments) for my soup, here is my soup(song) - tweak with FX(spice) after getting the main beat down - clay = bricks = house analogy
- get a base sound/sample/preset, add FX to create unique sounds

- 'Found Sounds' = music found in the real world used for your mixes - be the change, you want to sean in the world - be the autist chasing down the monk with the taiko drum/shamisen(shawnIsean - it was destined) with a high quality mic - some poor dudes at a garage just trying to work off a hangover as some autist comes after them for their highly coveted lug wrench sounds and industrial metal on metal - The feds and 'big sound INC TM(native instruments)' don't want you to know this, but you can just go to the park and pick up sounds, they are free. Sounds aren't real. They are just perturbASeans in a medium. MEdia. My Canvas: . My Paintbrush: . My Paint: .

> 4 things make up all Synths (foundation/base-frame-bricks-roof):
> 1) Oscillators - 2) Filters - 3) LFOs - 4)ADSR/Amplitude Envelope
> 1) Oscillators = The Part of the synth that makes the sound - Creates/Shapes the waveform - Different Wave forms sound like how they look - cartesian space, map the coords(sine wave creates a circle) 
> - Sine Waves(most basic type of sound wave-Round)
> - Saw Wave(Jagged/Rough-Sharp)
> - Square Wave(Inbetween a Saw Wave and and a Sine Wave-Sharp Sine)
> Many Synths have more than one oscillator which will allow you to layer sounds and create more interesting and complex sounds - put different wave forms together = fuller sound - adding octaves is a great way to fill up space in your tracks - 
> 2) Filters = Similar to EQ - Can turn frequencies up or down - can filter out parts of the frequency spectrum - (HP)High Pass = Lower Limit(removes low frequency content) / (LP)Low Pass = Upper Limit(removes higher frequency content) -  the HP/LP names are inverted High removes low, named after what you are trying to keep, not what you are trying to remove - You can also raise or lower the frequencies if they are... too low or high - dB = the higher the number, the more it will affect the frequencies - move the cut off up or down, anything after the cutoff will be removed - resonance = is a spike in the frequency spectrum within the filter 
> 3) LFO(Low Frequency Oscillator) = Will change the speed of your sound - Different than oscillators, by itself the LFO doesn't do anything - You can even change the LFO to match the beat of your track with the ratio = 1/4 notes 1/8 notes 1/16, whatever speed you need for tempo - Amplitude/Intensity/Depth(synonymous) = How 'tall' the waveform of the LFO is, turning it up makes it stronger Ups and Downs/Peaks and valleys, turning it down decreases the variaSeans 
> 4) ADSR(Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) /Amplitude Envelope = Finishing touch on sound - important - the 'shape' of the sound, how long it takes to reach full volume, and drop off - the 'timing' of the synth - he protec, he attac, he decay - 
> - 'Attack' = How long it takes for the synth to reach full volume (first peak)
> - 'Decay' = How long the first peak takes to fade away 
> - 'Sustain' = Secondary Peak after the decay - how it is after the initial attack
> - 'Release' = final decay of sound - long release sounds like a natural reverb - short is an abrupt end
> you can automate the LFO to come in over time, so it can add an effect 
> Use this all as a check list for making own sounds
