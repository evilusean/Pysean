- pick a genre/artist/track you love - copy/recreate/replicate it - learn by doing what the best have already done - immitateSean is the highest form of flattery - use it as a template - learn the techniques - the skills you learn replicating a track can be taken and used for every other track you create
- Download high quality of tracks(not youtube) - Beatport - bring it into DAW - make sure project tempo matches tempo of song
- Trap BPM = 130-150 BPMs.

- Focus on the drum beat first = 4-4 kick drum by Avicii(RIP)/Deadmau5 most common - a kick on every 4 beats - inbetween those beats an open hat or a closed hat - and on every other kick(2nd and 4th kick) add a clap or snare
- Add a bassline = Long sustained bassline Vs Bass between kicks Vs Syncopated bass line = split into 1/16ths
- add Choords third
- get the beat in first before equalizers or compression - crawl - walk - run (Based. Lol, Lmao. bassed? bass'd?)
- Silence is an instrument 
- Get the Balance right(faders) - accentuate what the main part of the song is
- Audio Fatigue = same sound repeated creates fatigue in the listener
- Layer sounds - instead of just one kick drum, create 3 with slight differences, in pitch or tempo, different midi or wav files - you can use JS plugins/macros in Reaper to select every odd or even note and then change the velocity/pitch/length on each 
- Create/select sounds first, then create the song, so you aren't busy making sounds in the middle of a mix, here are the ingredients(instruments) for my soup, here is my soup(song) - tweak with FX(spice) after getting the main beat down - clay = bricks = house analogy
- get a base sound/sample, add FX to create unique sounds 
- Aphex(FX? Effects? Affects? Apex? was that intentional?) Chad Unique Samples : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wIOBBodoic&ab_channel=BennJordan
