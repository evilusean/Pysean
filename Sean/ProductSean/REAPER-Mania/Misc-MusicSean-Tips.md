- pick a genre/artist/track you love - copy/recreate/replicate it - learn by doing what the best have already done - immitateSean is the most sincere form of flattery - use it as a template - learn the techniques - the skills you learn replicating a track can be taken and used for every other track you create

- Focus on the drum beat first = 4-4 kick drum by Avicii(RIP)/Deadmau5 most common - a kick on every 4 beats - inbetween those beats an open hat or a closed hat - and on every other kick(2nd and 4th kick) add a clap or snare
- Add a bassline = Long sustained bassline Vs Bass between kicks Vs Syncopated bass line = split into 1/16ths
- add Choords third
- get the beat in first before equalizers or compression - crawl - walk - run (Based. Lol, Lmao. bassed? bass'd?)
- Silence is an instrument 
- Get the Balance right(faders) - accentuate what the main part of the song is
- Audio Fatigue = same sound repeated creates fatigue in the listener
- Layer sounds - instead of just one kick drum, create 3 with slight differences, in pitch or tempo, different midi or wav files - you can use JS plugins/macros in Reaper to select every odd or even note and then change the velocity/pitch/length on each 
- Don't tune your kick - you autismo - 1/8 is a good size for decent soundsystems - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bzu8xNp5X4&ab_channel=SolState - this contradicts the last dude I listened to yesterday - who do you trust more? some dude on youtube or Deadmau5?
- Create/select sounds first, then create the song, so you aren't busy making sounds in the middle of a mix, here are the ingredients(instruments) for my soup, here is my soup(song) - tweak with FX(spice) after getting the main beat down - clay = bricks = house analogy
- get a base sound/sample/preset, add FX to create unique sounds

- 'Found Sounds' = music found in the real world used for your mixes - be the change, you want to sean in the world - be the autist chasing down the monk with the taiko drum/shamisen(shawnIsean - it was destined) with a high quality mic - some poor dudes at a garage just trying to work off a hangover as some autist comes after them for their highly coveted lug wrench sounds and industrial metal on metal - The feds and 'big sound INC TM(native instruments)' don't want you to know this, but you can just go to the park and pick up sounds, they are free. Sounds aren't real. They are just perturbASeans in a medium. MEdia. My Canvas: . My Paintbrush: . My Paint: .
