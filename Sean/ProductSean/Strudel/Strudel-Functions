.arrange = How to create a song instead of just cycles =======================================================================================================================================
.arrange(
    [2, build],      // 2 bars of buildup
    [2, predrop],    // 2 bars of pre-drop tension
    [16, drop],      // 16 bars of the main drop/chorus
    [16, verse],     // 16 bars of the verse
    [4, postverse],  // 4 bars of post-verse transition
  )
  You can use the .arrange() function in Strudel to sequence patterns over multiple cycles, effectively building a song structure (like Verse-Chorus-Bridge) instead of a simple looping cycle.
  Here's how to use it and the key concepts involved:
  1. The Purpose of .arrange() üèóÔ∏è
    The .arrange() function takes a list of patterns and plays them one after the other. This allows you to define different musical sections 
    (like a 4-bar intro, an 8-bar verse, and a 4-bar chorus) and string them together into a longer piece that only loops when the entire arrangement is complete.
  2. Basic Syntax and Structure
    You apply .arrange() to a pattern that you want to sequence. The pattern passed to .arrange() contains the names or references to the different sections you define.
  Step 1: Define Your Musical Sections - First, you define your different sections (like a verse, chorus, and breakdown) as separate variables.
    A common way to make a section last for a specific number of bars is by multiplying the pattern.
  // Define a 4-bar intro pattern (plays a hi-hat pattern four times)
  let intro = s("hh*8").gain(0.6).fast(2) * 4
  // Define an 8-bar verse pattern (plays a basic beat eight times)
  let verse = stack(
    s("bd*2"),
    s("~ sd").every(2, fast(2))
  ) * 8
  Step 2: Create the Arrangement -Next, you create a new pattern that references the sections you defined and use .arrange() to string them together.
    // This pattern defines the order of the song sections
    let songStructure = "<intro verse intro>"
  Step 3: Apply the Arrangement - Finally, you apply the .arrange() function to the songStructure pattern.
    // The final code to play the song
    setcps(120/4) // Set tempo to 120 BPM, 1 cycle = 1 bar
    // This executes the sections in order: Intro (4 bars) -> Verse (8 bars) -> Intro (4 bars) -> and then loops the whole sequence (16 bars).
    songStructure.arrange(intro, verse)
  Key Concept: Time Alignment - When using .arrange():
  The pattern you pass into arrange() (e.g., songStructure) determines when to switch to the next section.
  The actual length of the patterns you defined (intro, verse) determines how long each section plays. Strudel waits for the current arranged pattern to finish its 
    full length before moving to the next one in the sequence.
