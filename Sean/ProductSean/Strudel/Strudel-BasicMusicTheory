To make music with Strudel, you'll need to understand the core concepts of rhythm, pitch, and patterns. Strudel operates on a system of cycles,
  where each cycle has a fixed length in time and a certain number of beats.

Essential Music Theory for Strudel :
Pitch Notation: Strudel uses a standard octave and note naming system. Notes are represented by letters (c, d, e, f, g, a, b). 
  You can specify the octave by adding a number, e.g., c4 for middle C.

Rhythm (Durations): Rhythms are defined by numbers. 1 is a whole note (the length of one full cycle), 2 is a half note, 4 is a quarter note, and so on. 
  You can use fractions for more complex rhythms, such as 3/2 for a dotted half note.

Sequences and Patterns: Strudel creates music by combining sequences of pitches and rhythms. You can create a sequence by separating notes with spaces (c e g), 
  and you can combine multiple patterns using special operators to create polyrhythms and complex phrases.

Cycle Length and Beats :
A fundamental concept in Strudel is the cycle. A cycle is the basic unit of time that your patterns repeat over.

How long is a cycle?
A cycle in Strudel is one second long.

How many beats per cycle?
There are four beats per cycle, as Strudel's default time signature is 4/4. You can change the time signature,
  but the cycle length remains one second. This means a quarter note (4) is equal to one beat, and a beat is 250 milliseconds long.

In summary, Strudel's core is based on a one-second cycle with four beats, and you build your musical ideas by creating patterns of notes and rhythms within that repeating cycle.
