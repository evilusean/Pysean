To make music with Strudel, you'll need to understand the core concepts of rhythm, pitch, and patterns. Strudel operates on a system of cycles,
  where each cycle has a fixed length in time and a certain number of beats.

Essential Music Theory for Strudel :
Pitch Notation: Strudel uses a standard octave and note naming system. Notes are represented by letters (c, d, e, f, g, a, b). 
  You can specify the octave by adding a number, e.g., c4 for middle C.

Rhythm (Durations): Rhythms are defined by numbers. 1 is a whole note (the length of one full cycle), 2 is a half note, 4 is a quarter note, and so on. 
  You can use fractions for more complex rhythms, such as 3/2 for a dotted half note.

Sequences and Patterns: Strudel creates music by combining sequences of pitches and rhythms. You can create a sequence by separating notes with spaces (c e g), 
  and you can combine multiple patterns using special operators to create polyrhythms and complex phrases.

Cycle Length and Beats :
A fundamental concept in Strudel is the cycle. A cycle is the basic unit of time that your patterns repeat over.

How long is a cycle?
A cycle in Strudel is one second long.

How many beats per cycle?
There are four beats per cycle, as Strudel's default time signature is 4/4. You can change the time signature,
  but the cycle length remains one second. This means a quarter note (4) is equal to one beat, and a beat is 250 milliseconds long.

In summary, Strudel's core is based on a one-second cycle with four beats, and you build your musical ideas by creating patterns of notes and rhythms within that repeating cycle.

In music theory, when you have two different rhythmic patterns, they will only align, or "hit together," at a point that is a multiple of their Least Common Multiple (LCM).
LCM: The smallest positive number that is a multiple of two or more numbers.
The Rule: To find when two rhythms with different beat counts will align, you must find their LCM.
  This number represents the number of beats that must pass before both patterns repeat simultaneously.
Example: For a 3-beat pattern and a 4-beat pattern, the LCM is 12. This means they will hit together on beats 12, 24, 36, and so on.
  They will not necessarily align at the end of a musical phrase unless the phrase length is a multiple of their LCM.

16-Beat Cycle (4 Bars)
This is the shortest and most manageable loop. It's the perfect starting point for building a solid foundation for your track.
Purpose: The core rhythmic idea.
How to Build It:
Bars 1-2: Establish your main drum groove. This could be a basic kick and snare pattern.
Bars 3-4: Add simple rhythmic variations or a new element, such as a hi-hat or a bass note.
Result: You have a tight, repetitive, and memorable loop.

32-Beat Cycle (8 Bars)
This is a very common loop length for a main phrase or section in a song. It gives you enough room to develop your idea without losing the listener's attention.
Purpose: The main musical phrase.
How to Build It:
Bars 1-4: Start with your 16-beat core loop from above.
Bars 5-6: Add a new melodic element or a counter-rhythm. This could be a synthesizer chord or a counter-snare pattern.
Bars 7-8: Introduce a subtle change to build anticipation for the next loop. This could be a crash cymbal, a filter sweep, or a missing kick drum beat.
Result: A fully developed musical phrase that feels complete but is ready for the next section.

64-Beat Cycle (16 Bars)
This is a longer phrase used for building more complex arrangements and variations. It's ideal for a full verse or chorus section.
Purpose: A complete musical section with a sense of progression.
How to Build It:
Bars 1-8: Use your 32-beat phrase as the foundation.
Bars 9-12: Introduce another new element, like an arpeggiated synth or a sub-bass line.
Bars 13-14: Reduce the texture to create a breakdown. This could involve removing the bassline or the kick drum to give the listener a moment of space.
Bars 15-16: Reintroduce elements to transition back into the main phrase with more impact. This is where you would build tension before the pattern starts over.
Result: A dynamic and evolving section that tells a complete story and feels like it's moving forward.

Build a rhytym that repeats ever 2/3/4/6/8/16 bars and they will all hit together during the LCM phase - You also need to consider the duration of each (1 or 2 bars vs 3, etc)
