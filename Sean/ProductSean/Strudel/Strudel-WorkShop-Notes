WORKSHOP // Coding Music With Strudel // Dan Gorelick and Viola He : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqyAJ4WeKoU
s("sd bd cp") # 's' is short for 'sound' 'sd' = snare drum, 'bd' = base drum, cp = clap
s("bd hh sd hh") # in strudel only the last 'block' will play unless you add a ',' like below but it highlights what is playing so you know
stack(
  s("<bd bd*2> ~"),
  s("~ sd"),
  s("~ cp ~ cp"),
  s("hhx8?"),
) 
on the right hand side tabs click the 'sounds' tab, and you can see all the built in sounds that strudel has, just click them
  each sound will have a number like 'sound(#)' the '#' is how many sounds, so you can select through it for 'jazz(8)' has 8 sounds, so you can go through 1-8 with 'jazz:1'
on the right hand side tabs click the 'reference' tab to get a list of all the functions you can use to alter the sounds
stack (
s("jazz <~ jazz> ~ <[~ jazz] ~>"),
s("cp hh sd hh")) 
# theres 2 types of brackets '[]' = divide a beat '<>' = a selection, if you have 2 things in the angle brackets, it will cycle through them 1 by 1
