This project aims to make a conversion between guitar chords/riffs and translate it into a strudel readable/playable format : 
Hard Mode (free) : OCR with OpenCV (or similar) software that converts tabs images into standard musical notation (without the tempo or note size/duration) which then again needs to be converted into a strudel mini notation chord

Easy Mode(but expensive) : GuitarPro (paid app) can convert tabs into standard musical notation then translate that again into strudels mini notation - 
  There are free apps like 'MuseScore' or 'TuxGuitar' that can read '.gp' files - https://klang.io/guitar2tabs/
Using Guitar Pro or similar software to work with `.gp` files is the best way to convert tabs into a format that Strudel can read because it automates the most difficult parts of the process. 
  Instead of manually translating each note and guessing the rhythm, the software does it for you.

### Why Guitar Pro is the Best Solution
- **Rhythm and Timing are Preserved:** Guitar Pro files, unlike many plain text tabs found online, contain all the rhythmic information. The software knows if a note is a quarter note, 
  an eighth note, a sixteenth note, and so on. This is essential for a language like Strudel, which is built on precise rhythmic patterns.
- **Accurate Pitch Conversion:** Guitar Pro correctly identifies the pitch of each note based on its string and fret position. This saves you from having to manually figure out that, 
for example, a "5" on the second string (B string) is an E note in the next octave up.
    
- **MIDI Export:** The main reason these programs are so useful is their **ability to export to MIDI**. ðŸŽ¹ MIDI files are a universal language for music; 
  they contain all the note and timing data in a structured format. Strudel can directly read and interpret MIDI information. By exporting a `.gp` file to MIDI, you get a clean,
  digital version of the music that can be used to generate your Strudel patterns.
    
### The Conversion Workflow
The general process is straightforward:

1. **Open the `.gp` file** in Guitar Pro, TuxGuitar, or MuseScore.
    
2. **Export the file** as a MIDI file (`.mid`).
    
3. **Read the MIDI data** in your Strudel environment. While Strudel doesn't have a direct "import MIDI file" button, you can use JavaScript libraries or other methods to
  parse the MIDI data and convert it into Strudel's notation.
    
4. **Write the Strudel code** based on the pitches and rhythms from the MIDI file. You can then use the Strudel functions like `note()` to create your patterns,
  or even use tools that automatically convert MIDI to Strudel's specific text format.
    
This workflow eliminates the tedious and error-prone manual conversion from tablature, making it the most efficient and accurate method.
