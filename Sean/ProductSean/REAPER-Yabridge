Trying to get VST's (Virtual Studio Technology) to work on my Arch Linx(btw) with Reaper setup. Creating this for notes for future Sean.
'sudo pacman -S wine' #install wine to run windows programs
-Configure Reaper to Search for plugins in the Wine installation directory
'sudo pacman -S yabridge' #acts as a bridge between windows VST's running in wine from windows to linux to reaper
-Configure Reaper to scan for plugins in the yabridge managed directories
