Trying to get VST's (Virtual Studio Technology) to work on my Arch Linx(btw) with Reaper setup. Creating this for notes for future Sean.
'sudo pacman -S wine' #install wine to run windows programs
-Configure Reaper to Search for plugins in the Wine installation directory = By default wine will install VST's in the home directory, '.wine' is hidden by default '~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/VSTPlugins' 
'sudo pacman -S yabridge' #acts as a bridge between windows VST's running in wine from windows to linux to reaper
-Configure Reaper to scan for plugins in the yabridge managed directories
'sudo pacman -S yabridgectl' #also need this
"yabridgectl add '/home/ArchSean/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/VstPlugin/'" #also notice the single quotes because of the space, this should add the wine directory to the VST list
'yabridgectl sync' #after adding the new plugins to the list, you need to resync in yabridgectl and then rescan in reaper
Finally got it, Sometimes when you install, they install to their own directory in 'Program Files' - you need to add that aswell, then resync, but now you can use windows plugins on linux
