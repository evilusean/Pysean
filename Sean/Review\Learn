Active Directory - MS Built in keylogger - Everything in a corporation ends in active directory, from identity management to secrets to logging, it's the heart of every corporation. 
  Attackers always crack active directory first and then start plundering and damaging the corporation from this central point.
  Do these hacking challenges that involve active directory networks and learn from that. Ofc you also need to know common attack techniques and tools and need to know how to program

DNS Vs Phishing - create an exact duplicate clone of a website(FB/Gram/etc) that saves whatever inputs the user puts in for login and saves, will then put in actual website <input form> 
  change their DNS record for whenever they go to 'the official' site it will instead redirect to yours, once they succesfully logged in, send them to the actual site

Leetcode is easily teachable. It's just 15 overall patterns / approaches described in different ways. Having worked in Big Tech, I prefer the pre-Cracking the Coding Interview style of interviews.
Start with top 100 liked questions, start with 50 easy/medium, solve at least 20 questions for each 'topic' until it 'clicks', learn from the soluseans, if you are stuck on a problem for >45 min look up answer, review in 2 weeks 
'topics' = string -> two pointer -> sliding window -> binary search -> recursion -> binary tree -> backtracking -> BFS -> DFS -> graph -> linked list -> sort -> trie -> stack qeue -> priority qeue -> dynamic programming
Most Leetcode problems are recgonizing which core algorithm is required and succesfully implementing it - problem solving = pattern recgoniSean

jeetcode its actually based but infested with pajeets. every problem you solve add the subroutine to a class file. then add that project to github. then presto you just made a portfolio. if you dont have 6 cool projects pinned on 
your github you are a failure. leetcode is actually based because its readymade problems you can solve in your favorite language. shoot for building your github portfolio and focus on length of lines of code produced rather 
than quality of coding, add everything to github source control... everything. challenge yourself to do 10,000 lines of code in 2 months or so. start off doing as many easy problems as you can do. once you are satisfied
start trying some mediums. once you learn a new skill/data structure like linked lists or trees you will have some basic starter code to complete the problem, but then you can use variations of that same code to pop like 30
problems in a day with minimal adjustments. dont even look at hards until you are ready because almost all of them have big O notation run time complexities meaning something you can solve with a simple double for loop 
wont be accepted and actually needs to be using a famous linear algorithm in a computer science textbook like kadane or djisktra or euclid. fuckin rock that coding and get a jeetjob bro!
