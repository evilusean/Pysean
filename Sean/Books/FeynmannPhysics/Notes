Preface+Foreward ==================================================================================================================================================================
"I think the system is a failure... there isn't any solution to the problem of education... It's impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture..."
-5IQ points per generasean - we are getting dumber Vs Verbatim powerpoints / common core / Sabotage the youth, then blaME them

1-1 Atoms in Motion ===============================================================================================================================================================
"Laws, which summarize all our knowledge"
"Euclidean Geometry - where we state the axioms and then make all sorts of deductions...
We can not do it this way for two reasons. First, we do not yet know all the basic laws, there is an expanding frontier of ignorance..
Second, the correct statement of the laws of physics involves some very unfamiliar ideas.. one needs a considerable amount of prepatory training even to learn what the words mean."
"Each piece or part is always merely an approximation of the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it"
"things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected"
"The test of all knowledge is experiment. experiment is the sole judge of scientific truth.. how can the result of an experiment be wrong? only by being inaccurate"
1-2 = Matter is made of atoms = 
by volume, an atom is mostly empty space, dominated by the electron cloud, the dense atomic nucleus, responsible for only 1 part in 10^15 of an atom's volume, contains ~99.95% of an atom's mass
Avogadros Number = 6.022 × 10²³ = Take an apple, magnify it to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are equivalent to the size of an apple
"All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another"
"best optical microscope available - roughly 2,000 times" -1961
"particles that are 'stuck together' that they attract eachother"
The atoms are 1 or 2 x 10^-8 cm in radius(to the power of 8) = angstrom 
If an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple
increase the temperature increase the motion.. perpetual motion in all directions.. hold the piston down by a certain force, which we call pressure.. pressure is proportional to the density
increase the temperaute.. the atoms hit harder because they are moving faster, and in addition they hit more often, so the pressure increases
when we compress gas slowly, the temperature of the gas increases, slow expansion will decrease the temperature
the difference between solids and liquids is, that in a solid the atoms are arranged in some kind of an array called a crystalline array
most simple substances with the exception of water and type metal, expand upon melting
all of the atoms are vibrating 'in place' as we increase the temperature, they vibrate with greater and greater amplitude, until they shake themselves out of place - we call this melting
helium, even at absolute zero does not melt
1.3 = Atomic Processes =
Surface water in the air - water evaporation - water vapor 
Why do we see no change? because just as much water is leaving as is coming back - in the long run 'nothing happens'
If you wish to evaporate water, turn on a fan / dehumidifier, blow on soup to cool it
liquid gradually cools if it evaporates
air consists almost entirely of nitrogen: By volume, the dry air in Earth's atmosphere is about 78.08 percent nitrogen, 20.95 percent oxygen, and 0.93 percent argon, carbon = 0.04 percent <- this is what they tell you to be afraid of.
  Give us all your money, or the planet will get angry and burn/drown you all - trust the $cience - neo priests - normies havn't changed in thousands of years - IFL$cience
An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons or has lost a few electrons
1.4 = Chemical Reactions =
