# Feynnmann's Formulae:</br>

Asked AI how to get started on this project, answer below:</br>
Using XeLaTeX to showcase Feynman's physics and math formulas is a great way to learn and visualize them. Here's how you can get started:</br>

## 1. Setting Up the Project:</br>

Install XeLaTeX: If you haven't already, install XeLaTeX on your system. It's available for most operating systems.</br>
Choose an Editor: Pick a text editor that supports XeLaTeX, like Texmaker, TeXstudio, or Visual Studio Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension.</br>
Create a New File: In your chosen editor, create a new file with the .tex extension. This will be your main document file.</br>

## 2. Basic Structure:</br>

Start your document with the following basic structure:</br>
\documentclass{article} % Choose a suitable document class</br>
\usepackage{amsmath} % Include the amsmath package for advanced math typesetting</br>
\usepackage{physics} % Include the physics package for physics-specific symbols</br>
\usepackage{xltxtra} % Include the xltxtra package for additional XeLaTeX features</br>
\usepackage{fontspec} % Include the fontspec package for font customization</br>
\setmainfont{YourFontName} % Set your desired font</br>

\begin{document}</br>
% Your formula notes content goes here</br>
\end{document}</br>

## 3. Adding Formulas:</br>

Within the \begin{document} and \end{document} block, you can start adding formulas using LaTeX syntax. Here are some examples:</br>
Simple formula: $E=mc^2$</br>
Fraction: $\frac{1}{2}$</br>
Integral: $\int_a^b f(x) dx$</br>
Multi-line equation:</br>
\begin{align*}</br>
a &= b + c \\</br>
d &= e + f</br>
\end{align*}</br>

## 4. Organizing Your Notes:</br>

Sections and Subsections: Use \section and \subsection commands to organize your notes into different sections and subsections.</br>
Lists and Tables: Use \begin{itemize} and \begin{table} environments to create lists and tables for better organization.</br>
Comments: Use % to add comments within your code for explanation or future reference.</br>

## 5. Compiling and Viewing:</br>

Once you've added your formulas and content, save your .tex file. Then, compile it using XeLaTeX.
Your editor might have a built-in compile button or you can use the command line. After compilation,
you'll have a PDF file containing your formula notes.</br>

Additional Tips:</br>
Explore the documentation of the amsmath, physics, and xltxtra packages for more advanced features and customization options.</br>
Refer to online resources and tutorials for learning LaTeX syntax and best practices.</br>
Consider using version control systems like Git to track your project's progress and collaborate with others.</br>
Remember, this is just a starting point. As you progress, you can customize your document with different fonts, colors, layouts, and even interactive elements.</br>

I hope this helps you get started on your exciting project!</br>
