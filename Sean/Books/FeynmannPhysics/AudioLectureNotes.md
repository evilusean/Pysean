Last Lecture: 3

Remember, this is where we were at in the 1960's, when the lectures were given, we haven't progressed anywhere since then, this is STILL what they teach - I want to get into Electrical Engineering, but I am gatekept because we don't do apprenticeships any longer and I need a piece of paper to prove I am competent, a degrEE. I want to build cool sh!t, but can't without having a piece of paper.
