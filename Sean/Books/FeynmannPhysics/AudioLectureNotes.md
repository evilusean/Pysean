Last Lecture: 08

#### Preamble :
Remember, this is where we were at in the 1960's, when the lectures were given, we haven't progressed anywhere since then, this is STILL what they teach - I want to get into Electrical Engineering, but I am gatekept because we don't do apprenticeships any longer and I need a piece of paper to prove I am competent, a degrEE. Coding is a skill, which I now have to compete with half the world with, some dude in punjab who hadn't seen a computer until his early 20's somehow has a masters degree in CompSci, and is, according to jboomer standards, technically more employable than me. I also now have to compete with billions of people and AI for the new labor arbitrage. I want to build cool sh!t, but can't without having a piece of paper. This seemed(seaned?) like a good place to start. Covid cultists/branch covidians kicked me out of university for not worshipping at the church of big pharma/big govt/TV and drinking the kool aid flavored mystery $cience juice. I was right, again, for years, and punished for it, I'm years behind, AGAIN, because you idiots lied to me-I think the count is almost 3 decades at this point that you idiots have stolen from me(and that is just time, not counting half my income in taxes/inflateSean/lost opportunity cost/rule of 72/forced me to pay into a ponzi scheme(P < P + I)/etc - you are all so deeply negative, I genuinely don't see how you are climbing out of that hole), where is my remuneraSean? My grievances aren't sean as legitimate. At least I don't have to wonder everytime I get chest pain if that was because I took the fauci ouchie or if it was from the burrito I ate for lunch. I still haven't received one apology. They really don't think they are responsible for their own actions. Poison the kids to save grandma, because the TV told me to. Do you guys understand how people are going to look back on this time? Like lobotomies, or leeches in the middle ages. Tyrants are useless without the wall of idiots who follow everything they say. At least now I know how to code, and can work anywhere in the world remotely now with my new skill, if the idiots wanna FA again, they FO when I leave to countries who aren't majority populated by brainwashed insane people, who think that as long as they are the majority, they must be right. Nope, just makes alot(ALOT-86% at last count) of idiots, who then attack the people who don't think like them, this is why they are called NPC's, incapable of self-reflectSean. Move on to the next current thing, forget about the last current thing, and do it all again. It's all so tiresome.

#### 4:Conservation of Energy-2024-11-02
- RefractSean: without breaking the law of conservation of energy, how does light slow down and then speed up again when changing mediums? (from air -> water -> air :) who is giving muh photons the energy to speed up, again, without breaking the law of conservation of energy, does zombie einstein roll out of his shallow grave to push every particle back up to full speed again? Vs wave particle duality - we don't even kNOw what we don't know - PerturbASean
- there is no exception to this law 'there is a certain quantity of energy, that doesn't change in the manifold nature change that it undergoes' - a mathematical principle - the quantity doesn't change' - if they can't add it all together and find the missing energy they just create another variable, '"ah yes, that's where it went, to X, balance in all things"'
- energy can neither be created nor be destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another
- Perpetual motion does not exist - weight machines
- Potential Energy / Gravitational Potential energy / Electrical Potential Energy = general principle is that the Force x Distance(F times D) that it is moved is the change in energy 
- Gravitational Potential Energy = (weight) * (height)
- Change in ergu = (force) * (distance force acts through)
- ###### For below image and after, I clicked and dragged the SVG from 'https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_04.html' - but I don't actually see a SVG file in obsidian, and when I save it to github, it gives me an empty link and not a SVG file, I can see the SVG files now, currently, but no idea where they are being saved locally if they are at all, so I have no idea how the image SVG's are being referenced, so if they disapear, I got them from the website, future sean. 
- ![[f04-01_tc_big.svg]]
- How much weight is required to move the 1 pound weight and balance it on the (3,4,5 triangle)? 
- ![[f04-03_tc_big_b.svg]]
-  In high school we learned a lot of laws about pulleys and levers used in different ways. We can now see that these “laws” are all the same thing, and that we did not have to memorize 75 rules to figure it out.
- Energy is Sum of Several "Forms" (or ways of calculating)(or ways of calculating).
- principle of virtual work - in order to do the work, you had to imagine the work and small amounts of motion to figure it out
- ![[f04-05_tc_big.svg]]
- Kinetic Energy
- ![[f04-07_tc_big.svg]]
- conversion of gravitational energy into some other form 
- velocity: K.E.=WH (kinetic energy = weight * height)
- K.E.=WV2/2g (Kinetic energy = Weight * Velocity squared / 2) = This is the formula for figuring out the height an object with velocity can go to then do the weight * height calculation - both of these formulas are approximate and relativistic 
- gravitational constant = squared '/2'
- Elastic energy. = If we pull down on a spring, we must do some work, for when we have it down, we can lift weights with it. Therefore in its stretched condition it has a possibility of doing some work. If we were to evaluate the sums of weights times heights, it would not check out—we must add something else to account for the fact that the spring is under tension. Elastic energy is the formula for a spring when it is stretched. How much energy is it? If we let go, the elastic energy, as the spring passes through the equilibrium point, is converted to kinetic energy and it goes back and forth between compressing or stretching the spring and kinetic energy of motion.
- heat energy = t, the spring or the lever is _warmer_, and that there is really an increase of kinetic energy by a definite amount. We call this form of energy _heat energy_, but we know that it is not really a new form, it is just kinetic energy—internal motion. (One of the difficulties with all these experiments with matter that we do on a large scale is that we cannot really demonstrate the conservation of energy and we cannot really make our reversible machines, because every time we move a large clump of stuff, the atoms do not remain absolutely undisturbed, and so a certain amount of random motion goes into the atomic system. We cannot see it, but we can measure it with thermometers - Entropy - Prigogine
- electrical energy = which has to do with pushing and pulling by electric charges.
- radiant energy = the energy of light, which we know is a form of electrical energy because light can be represented as wigglings in the electromagnetic field.
- chemical energy = the energy which is released in chemical reactions.
- elastic energy is, to a certain extent, like chemical energy, because chemical energy is the energy of the attraction of the atoms, one for the other, and so is elastic energy
- nuclear energy = the energy which is involved with the arrangement of particles inside the nucleus
- conservation of linear momentum. = associated in quantum mechanics with the proposition that it makes no difference where you do the experiment, the results will always be the same.
- conservation of angular momentum. = 
- You may have heard that photons come out in blobs and that the energy of a photon is - Planck’s constant times the frequency. That is true, but since the frequency of light can be anything, there is no law that says that energy has to be a certain definite amount
- Conservation of charge =  and that merely means that you count how many positive, minus how many negative electrical charges you have, and the number is never changed. You may get rid of a positive with a negative, but you do not create any net excess of positives over negatives.
- conservation of baryons = There are a number of strange particles, a neutron and a proton are examples, which are called baryons. In any reaction whatever in nature, if we count how many baryons are coming into a process, the number of baryon
- conservation of leptons =We can say that the group of particles called leptons are: electron, muon, and neutrino. There is an antielectron which is a positron, that is, a −1 lepton. Counting the total number of leptons in a reaction reveals that the number in and out never changes, at least so far as we know at present.
- These are the six conservation laws, three of them subtle, involving space and time, and three of them simple, in the sense of counting something.
-  The laws which govern how much energy is available are called the laws of thermodynamics and involve a concept called entropy for irreversible thermodynamic processes.
- . Our supplies of energy are from the sun, rain, coal, uranium, and hydrogen. The sun makes the rain, and the coal also, so that all these are from the sun.
-  If it can be controlled in thermonuclear reactions, it turns out that the energy that can be obtained from 10 quarts of water per second is equal to all of the electrical power generated in the United States. With 150 gallons of running water a minute, you have enough fuel to supply all the energy which is used in the United States today! Therefore it is up to the physicist to figure out how to liberate us from the need for having energy. It can be done.
#### 5:Time and Distance-2024-11-04
- Galileo did an experiment on motion which was essentially this: He allowed a ball to roll down an inclined trough and observed the motion. He did not, however, just look; he measured how far the ball went in how long a time
- Galileo’s first experiments on motion were done by using his pulse to count off equal intervals of time - We may count off beats of a pulse as the ball rolls down the track: “one … two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight …”  = the location of the ball is marked at 1, 2, 3, 4, … units of time from the instant of its release, those marks are distant from the starting point in proportion to the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, … Today we would say the distance is proportional to the square of the time
- What _is_ time? It would be nice if we could find a good definition of time. Webster defines “a time” as “a period,” and the latter as “a time"  - time is one of the things we probably cannot define (in the dictionary sense), and just say that it is what we already know it to be: it is how long we wait! What really matters anyway is not how we _define_ time, but how we measure it. One way of measuring time is to utilize something which happens over and over again in a regular fashion—something which is _periodic_. For example, a day. With an hour glass, we can “create” a periodic occurrence if we have someone standing by it day and night to turn it over whenever the last grain of sand runs out. We could then count the turnings of the glass from each morning to the next. We would find, this time, that the number of “hours” (i.e., turnings of the glass) was not the same each “day.” We should distrust the sun, or the glass, or both.
- we can measure it, yet not define it, show me 'a time' , seconds are a unit of measurement not 'time'
- electron-beam oscilloscope, which acts as a sort of microscope for short times. This device plots on a fluorescent screen a graph of electrical current (or voltage) versus time. By connecting the oscilloscope to two of our oscillators in sequence, so that it plots a graph first of the current in one of our oscillators and then of the current in the other, we get two graphs like those shown
- When we cannot count the years for the measurement of long times, we must look for other ways to measure. One of the most successful is the use of radioactive material as a “clock.” In this case we do not have a periodic occurrence, as for the day or the pendulum, but a new kind of “regularity.” We find that the radioactivity of a particular sample of material decreases by the same _fraction_ for successive equal increases in its age. 
- There are, fortunately, cases in which we can know the amount of radioactivity that was in an object when it was formed. We know, for example, that the carbon dioxide in the air contains a certain small fraction of the radioactive carbon isotope C14 (replenished continuously by the action of cosmic rays). If we measure the _total_ carbon content of an object, we know that a certain fraction of that amount was originally the radioactive C14; we know, therefore, the starting amount A to use in the formula above. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5000 years. By careful measurements we can measure the amount left after 2020 half-lives or so and can therefore “date” organic objects which grew as long as 100,000 years ago.
- When the uranium disintegrates, it changes into lead.
- ![[t05-01_tc_big.svg]]
- How does one subdivide distance? In the same way that we subdivided time: we take a smaller unit and count the number of such units it takes to make up the longer unit.
- PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM A2+B2=C2 : distance can be measured in another fashion: by triangulation. Although this means that we are really using a different definition of distance, when they can both be used they agree with each other. Space is more or less what Euclid thought it was
- able to use triangulation to measure the height of the first Sputnik. We found that it was roughly 5×10(5 exponent) meters high. By more careful measurements the distance to the moon can be measured in the same way. Two telescopes at different places on the earth can give us the two angles we need. It has been found in this way that the moon is 4×10(8 exponent) meters away.
- The distance of nearby stars can be measured by triangulation, using the diameter of the earth’s orbit as a baseline.
- we can mark off a thousand equal subdivisions of the millimeter to make a scale of microns (millionths of a meter). It is difficult to continue to smaller scales, because we cannot “see” objects smaller than the wavelength of visible light (about 5×10(−7 exponent) meter).
-  With an electron microscope, we can continue the process by making photographs on a still smaller scale, say down to 10(−8 exponent) from an observation of the way light of short wavelength (x-radiation) is reflected from a pattern of marks of known separation, we determine the wavelength of the light vibrations. Then, from the pattern of the scattering of the same light from a crystal, we can determine the relative location of the atoms in the crystal, obtaining results which agree with the atomic spacings also determined by chemical means
- ![[t05-02_tc_big.svg]]
- atoms are 99.9999999999996% empty space - 
- Measurements of distance and of time give results which depend on the observer. Two observers moving with respect to each other will not measure the same distances and times when measuring what appear to be the same things. Distances and time intervals have different magnitudes, depending on the coordinate system (or “frame of reference”) used for making the measurements. 
#### 6:Probability-2024-11-05
- By _chance_, we mean something like a guess. Why do we make guesses? We make guesses when we wish to make a judgment but have incomplete information or uncertain knowledge.
-  Any physical theory is a kind of guesswork. There are good guesses and there are bad guesses. The theory of probability is a system for making better guesses.
- We speak of probability only for observations that we contemplate being made in the future. _By the “probability” of a particular outcome of an observation we mean our estimate for the most likely fraction of a number of repeated observations that will yield that particular outcome_.
- In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a mathematical law that states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists. More formally, the LLN states that given a sample of independent and identically distributed values, the sample mean converges to the true mean. - the more times you do something, the more likely it is going to be closer to the probability 
- In Chapter [5](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_05.html) we described the size of a nucleus in terms of its apparent area, or “cross section.” When we did so we were really talking about probabilities. When we shoot a high-energy particle at a thin slab of material, there is some chance that it will pass right through and some chance that it will hit a nucleus.
- Raisin Bun model 'Bohr Rutherford'
- higgs boson gives me a hadron
- The number of “ways” to any point on the diagram is just the number of different “paths” (sequences of heads and tails) which can be taken from the starting point. The vertical position gives us the total number of heads thrown. The set of numbers which appears in such a diagram is known as _Pascal’s triangle_ Vs Wager. The numbers are also known as the _binomial coefficients_
- brownian motion = motion of atoms - the motion of a molecule, or of any particle, in a gas is like a random walk. Suppose we open a bottle of an organic compound and let some of its vapor escape into the air. If there are air currents, so that the air is circulating, the currents will also carry the vapor with them. But even in _perfectly still air_, the vapor will gradually spread out—will diffuse—until it has penetrated throughout the room.
- [Δx]⋅[Δv]≥ℏ/2m = This equation is a statement of the _Heisenberg uncertainty principle_ that we mentioned earlier.The uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must exist in any attempt to describe nature. Our most precise description of nature _must_ be in terms of _probabilities_.
- Einstein was quite worried about this problem. He used to shake his head and say, “But, surely God does not throw dice in determining how electrons should go!”
- our best “picture” of a hydrogen atom is a nucleus surrounded by an “electron cloud” (although we _really_ mean a “probability cloud”). The electron is there somewhere, but nature permits us to know only the _chance_ of finding it at any particular place.
- In its efforts to learn as much as possible about nature, modern physics has found that certain things can never be “known” with certainty. Much of our knowledge must always remain uncertain. The _most_ we can know is in terms of probabilities.
#### 7:The Theory of Gravitation-2024-11-06
- In this chapter we shall discuss one of the most far-reaching generalizations of the human mind. While we are admiring the human mind, we should take some time off to stand in awe of a _nature_ that could follow with such completeness and generality such an elegantly simple principle as the law of gravitation. What is this law of gravitation? It is that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which for any two bodies is proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of the distance between them. This statement can be expressed mathematically by the equation
- $F=G\frac{mm}{{r}{2}}$
- If to this we add the fact that an object responds to a force by accelerating in the direction of the force by an amount that is inversely proportional to the mass of the object, we shall have said everything required, for a sufficiently talented mathematician could then deduce all the consequences of these two principles
- The story begins with the ancients observing the motions of planets among the stars, and finally deducing that they went around the sun, a fact that was rediscovered later by Copernicus. Exactly _how_ the planets went around the sun, with exactly _what motion_, took a little more work to discover. Beginning in the sixteenth century there were great debates as to whether they really went around the sun or not. Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients: his idea was that these debates about the nature of the motions of the planets would best be resolved if the actual positions of the planets in the sky were measured sufficiently accurately. If measurement showed exactly how the planets moved, then perhaps it would be possible to establish one or another viewpoint. This was a tremendous idea—that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. Pursuing this idea, Tycho Brahe studied the positions of the planets for many years in his observatory on the island of Hven, near Copenhagen. He made voluminous tables, which were then studied by the mathematician Kepler, after Tycho’s death. Kepler discovered from the data some very beautiful and remarkable, but simple, laws regarding planetary motion.
- ![[Pasted image 20241108103656.png]]
- First of all, Kepler found that each planet goes around the sun in a curve called an _ellipse_, with the sun at a focus of the ellipse. An ellipse is not just an oval, but is a very specific and precise curve that can be obtained by using two tacks, one at each focus, a loop of string, and a pencil; more mathematically, it is the locus of all points the sum of whose distances from two fixed points (the foci) is a constant. Or, if you will, it is a foreshortened circle
- Kepler’s second observation was that the planets do not go around the sun at a uniform speed, but move faster when they are nearer the sun and more slowly when they are farther from the sun
- Finally, a third law was discovered by Kepler much later; this law is of a different category from the other two, because it deals not with only a single planet, but relates one planet to another. This law says that when the orbital period and orbit size of any two planets are compared, the periods are proportional to the 3/23/2 power of the orbit size. In this statement the period is the time interval it takes a planet to go completely around its orbit, and the size is measured by the length of the greatest diameter of the elliptical orbit, technically known as the major axis. More simply, if the planets went in circles, as they nearly do, the time required to go around the circle would be proportional to the 3/23/2 power of the diameter (or radius). Thus 
- ##### Kepler’s three laws are:
1.  Each planet moves around the sun in an ellipse, with the sun at one focus.
2. The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.
3. The squares of the periods of any two planets are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axes of their respective orbits: T∝a3/2
- While Kepler was discovering these laws, Galileo was studying the *laws of motion.* The problem was, what makes the planets go around? (In those days, one of the theories proposed was that the planets went around because behind them were invisible angels, beating their wings and driving the planets forward.
-  Galileo discovered a very remarkable fact about motion, which was essential for understanding these laws. That is the principle of _inertia_—if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (_Why_ does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)
- Newton modified this idea, saying that the only way to change the motion of a body is to use _force_. If the body speeds up, a force has been applied _in the direction of motion_. On the other hand, if its motion is changed to a new _direction_, a force has been applied _sideways_. Newton thus added the idea that a force is needed to change the speed _or the direction_ of motion of a body.
- the law is that the acceleration produced by the force is inversely proportional to the mass, or the force is proportional to the mass times the acceleration. The more massive a thing is, the stronger the force required to produce a given acceleration.F= M\*V
-  because of the principle of inertia, the force needed to control the motion of a planet around the sun is not a force _around_ the sun but _toward_ the sun. From his better understanding of the theory of motion, Newton appreciated that _the sun_ could be the seat or organization of forces that govern the motion of the planets -  _radial_—that the law of areas is a direct consequence of the idea that all of the forces are directed exactly _toward the sun_.
- the farther away the planet, the weaker the forces. If two planets at different distances from the sun are compared, the analysis shows that the forces are inversely proportional to the squares of the respective distances. With the combination of the two laws, Newton concluded that there must be a force, inversely as the square of the distance, directed in a line between the two objects.
- It was already known, for example, that the planet Jupiter had moons going around it as the moon of the earth goes around the earth, and Newton felt certain that each planet held its moons with a force. He already knew of the force holding _us_ on the earth, so he proposed that this was a _universal_ force—_that everything pulls everything else_.
- The All within A1L alchemical principle
- radius of the moon’s orbit (which is about 240,000 miles) and how long it takes to go around the earth (approximately 29 days)
- The law of gravitation explains many phenomena not previously understood. For example, the pull of the moon on the earth causes the tides, hitherto mysterious. The moon pulls the water up under it and makes the tides
- Everyone knows the earth is round. Why is the earth round? That is easy; it is due to gravitation. The earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!
-  there was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by Rømer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can find their schedules by waiting a very long time and finding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.) Now they were _ahead_ when Jupiter was particularly _close_ to the earth and they were _behind_ when Jupiter was _farther_ from the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. This phenomenon showed that light does not travel instantaneously, and furnished the first estimate of the speed of light. This was done in 1676.
- 'time' speeds up the closer you are to earth
- If all of the planets pull on each other, the force which controls, let us say, Jupiter in going around the sun is not just the force from the sun; there is also a pull from, say, Saturn. This force is not really strong, since the sun is much more massive than Saturn, but there is _some_ pull, so the orbit of Jupiter should not be a perfect ellipse, and it is not; it is slightly off, and “wobbles” around the correct elliptical orbit.
- In a galaxy we have a scale of perhaps 50,000 to 100,000 light years. The earth’s distance from the sun is 8.3 light _minutes_
- Gravity appears to exist at even bigger dimensions,  This is a _cluster of galaxies_, just like a star cluster. Thus galaxies attract each other at such distances that they too are agglomerated into clusters. Perhaps gravitation exists even over distances of _tens of millions_ of light years; so far as we now know, gravity seems to go out forever inversely as the square of the distance.
- ![[f07-13_tc_big.svg]]
- A simplified diagram of the apparatus used by Cavendish to verify the law of universal gravitation for small objects and to measure the gravitational constant G.
- This first demonstrated the direct force between two large, fixed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supported by a very fine fiber, called a torsion fiber. By measuring how much the fiber gets twisted, one can measure the strength of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately determine the coefficient G in the formula
-  By knowing G from this experiment and by knowing how strongly the earth attracts, we can indirectly learn how great is the mass of the earth! This experiment has been called *“weighing the earth”* by some people, and it can be used to determine the *coefficient G of the gravity law.* This is the only way in which the mass of the earth can be determined. G turns out to be:
- $6.670×{10}^{−11} newton⋅{m}^{2}/{kg}^{2}$
-  fact that all the moons and planets and stars have such a _simple rule_ to govern them, and further that man could _understand_ it and deduce how the planets should move! This is the reason for the success of the sciences in following years, for it gave hope that the other phenomena of the world might also have such beautifully simple laws.
- Electric Universe Vs Holographic Vs Turtles(all the way down): Next we shall discuss the possible relation of gravitation to other forces. There is no explanation of gravitation in terms of other forces at the present time. It is not an aspect of electricity or anything like that, so we have no explanation. However, gravitation and other forces are very similar, and it is interesting to note analogies. For example, the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation: the force of electricity is a constant, with a minus sign, times the product of the charges, and varies inversely as the square of the distance. It is in the opposite direction—likes repel. But is it still not very remarkable that the two laws involve the same function of distance? Perhaps gravitation and electricity are much more closely related than we think. Many attempts have been made to unify them; the so-called unified field theory is only a very elegant attempt to combine electricity and gravitation; but, in comparing gravitation and electricity, the most interesting thing is the _relative strengths_ of the forces.
- $$\frac{Gravitation Attraction}{Electrical Repulsion} = \frac{1}{4.17*{10}^{42}}$$
- If we take, in some natural units, the repulsion of two electrons (nature’s universal charge) due to electricity, and the attraction of two electrons due to their masses, we can measure the ratio of electrical repulsion to the gravitational attraction. The ratio is independent of the distance and is a fundamental constant of nature. The ratio is shown in Fig. [7–14](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F14). The gravitational attraction relative to the electrical repulsion between two electrons is 1 divided by $4.17*{10}^{42}$
- What is the meaning of life? 42.
- It is a fact that the force of gravitation is proportional to the _mass_, the quantity which is fundamentally a measure of _inertia_—of how hard it is to hold something which is going around in a circle. Therefore two objects, one heavy and one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same speed because of gravity, will stay together because to go in a circle _requires_ a force which is stronger for a bigger mass. That is, the gravity is stronger for a given mass in _just the right proportion_ so that the two objects will go around together. If one object were inside the other it would _stay_ inside; it is a perfect balance.
- Einstein’s modification of Newton’s law of gravitation. In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton’s law of gravitation is not correct! It was modified by Einstein to take into account the theory of relativity. According to Newton, the gravitational effect is instantaneous, that is, if we were to move a mass, we would at once feel a new force because of the new position of that mass; by such means we could send signals at infinite speed. Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we _cannot send signals faster than the speed of light_, so the law of gravitation must be wrong. By correcting it to take the delays into account, we have a new law, called Einstein’s law of gravitation. One feature of this new law which is quite easy to understand is this: In the Einstein relativity theory, anything which has _energy_ has mass—mass in the sense that it is attracted gravitationally. Even light, which has an energy, has a “mass.” When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected. During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which are around the sun should appear displaced from where they would be if the sun were not there, and this has been observed.
- '"Ein*Stein*"' -worked at a patent office, totaly not sus at all. Brilliant inventor or '"usual suspect"'? Nice patent you got there, you did that? we did that. I did that. 
- Muh Photons Vs Does light have a mass? Pick up a light particle and show it to me. Do you remember shaking all the photons out of the camera lens in order to take a picture?![[i-dont-believe-you-ron-burgundy.gif]]
- nothing is faster than the speed of light except 'muh spooky action at a distance' - quantum entanglement - his own ideas contradict his own ideas, We don't even know what we don't know, because we are fed garbage our entire lives. If something doesn't make sense? it is now spooky. Lol, Lmao. come on bro, ein*stein*, quantum, why can't you just STFU, pay your taxes, and Trust the $cience, where is your PHD? Where is your piece of paper? You need at least 8 more years of indoctrinateSean, that you pay for(sunk cost fallacy?), before you can laugh at us. 
- The fact that this dude is still idolized speaks to the very power of propaganda. Einsteins quantum and atomism(adamism?) has become an egregore in itself and almost a pseudo religion, with it's own tenants (We're all just pieces of matter(quantum-quantity), We're all just collections of chemicals, We're all just animals, bro - man who says everyone is an animal, behaves like an animal) and neo-priests, charlatans, and sophists.  
- atoms -> single celled amoeba -> multi celled -> bug -> fish -> 4 legged animal -> monkey -> man. return to monkee. the blood clotting process has 29 different steps, that if even one is missing, you will just bleed to death even from a small scratch, the fact that that process is just a chance event from atoms randomly bumping into each other over millions of years requires a leap of faith that parallels even the most fundamentalist religious sects, the big bang is also an article of faith, you gonna go back billions of years and witness the big bang? who created the big bang? unmoved mover. people who say god doesn't exist say we live in a simulasean. Lol, Lmao. Whose simulaSean? - you see the hypocrisy in those statements, right? NObody kNOws. 
#### 8:Motion-2024-11-12
##### 8–1Description of motion :
- In order to find the laws governing the various changes that take place in bodies as time goes on, we must be able to _describe_ the changes and have some way to record them. The simplest change to observe in a body is the apparent change in its position with time, which we call motion.
-   To determine the position of the car at different times, we measure its distance from the starting point and record all the observations.
- In Table [8–1](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_08.html#Ch8-T1), ss represents the distance of the car, in feet, from the starting point, and tt represents the time in minutes.
-  a falling ball. Table [8–2](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_08.html#Ch8-T2) gives the time in seconds and the distance in feet for a falling body. At zero seconds the ball starts out at zero feet, and at the end of 11 second it has fallen 1616 feet. At the end of 22 seconds, it has fallen 6464 feet, at the end of 33 seconds, 144144 feet, and so on; if the tabulated numbers are plotted, we get the nice parabolic curve shown in Fig. [8–2](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_08.html#Ch8-F2). The formula for this curve can be written as
- $s=16{t}^{2}$
- $s=f(t)$
-  there _are_ subtleties—several of them. In the first place, what do we mean by _time_ and _space?_ It turns out that these deep philosophical questions have to be analyzed very carefully in physics, and this is not so easy to do. The theory of relativity shows that our ideas of space and time are not as simple as one might think at first sight. However, for our present purposes, for the accuracy that we need at first, we need not be very careful about defining things precisely. Perhaps you say, “That’s a terrible thing—I learned that in science we have to define _everything_ precisely.” We cannot define _anything_ precisely! If we attempt to, we get into that paralysis of thought that comes to philosophers, who sit opposite each other, one saying to the other, “You don’t know what you are talking about!” The second one says, “What do you mean by _know?_ What do you mean by _talking?_ What do you mean by _you?_,” and so on.
##### 8–2 Speed :
- Greeks were never able to adequately describe problems involving velocity. The subtlety comes when we try to comprehend exactly what is meant by “speed.” The Greeks got very confused about this, and a new branch of mathematics had to be discovered beyond the geometry and algebra of the Greeks, Arabs, and Babylonians.
- Zeno produced a large number of paradoxes, of which we shall mention one to illustrate his point that there are obvious difficulties in thinking about motion. “Listen,” he says, “to the following argument: Achilles runs 1010 times as fast as a tortoise, nevertheless he can never catch the tortoise. For, suppose that they start in a race where the tortoise is 100100 meters ahead of Achilles; then when Achilles has run the 100100 meters to the place where the tortoise was, the tortoise has proceeded 1010 meters, having run one-tenth as fast. Now, Achilles has to run another 1010 meters to catch up with the tortoise, but on arriving at the end of that run, he finds that the tortoise is still 11 meter ahead of him; running another meter, he finds the tortoise 1010 centimeters ahead, and so on, _ad infinitum_. - a finite amount of time can be divided into an infinite number of pieces, just as a length of line can be divided into an infinite number of pieces by dividing repeatedly by two. And so, although there are an infinite number of steps (in the argument) to the point at which Achilles reaches the tortoise, it doesn’t mean that there is an infinite amount of _time_.
-  we remind you of a joke which you surely must have heard. At the point where the lady in the car is caught by a cop, the cop comes up to her and says, “Lady, you were going 60 miles an hour!” She says, “That’s impossible, sir, I was travelling for only seven minutes. It is ridiculous—how can I go 60 miles an hour when I wasn’t going an hour?” “What we mean, lady, is this: if you kept on going the same way as you are going now, in the next hour you would go 60 miles.” She could say, “Well, my foot was off the accelerator and the car was slowing down, so if I kept on going that way it would not go 60 miles.” “If I kept on going the way I’m going for one more hour, I would run into that wall at the end of the street!” It is not so easy to say what we mean. - we should use the instrument that measures the speed—the speedometer—and say, “Look, lady, your speedometer reads 60.” So she says, “My speedometer is broken and didn’t read at all.” Does that mean the car is standing still? ...  “Yes, of course, before you went an hour, you would hit that wall, but if you went one second, you would go 88 feet; lady, you were going 88 feet per second, and if you kept on going, the next second it would be 88 feet, and the wall down there is farther away than that.” She says, “Yes, but there’s no law against going 88 feet per second! There is only a law against going 60 miles an hour.” ..the point is that _for a moment_ she is going at that speed.
- We ask, how far do we go in a very short time? We divide that distance by the time, and that gives the speed. But the time should be made as short as possible, the shorter the better, because some change could take place during that time. in order to get the speed more and more accurately, we should take a smaller and smaller time interval.
-  That idea was to take an _infinitesimal distance_ and the corresponding _infinitesimal time_, form the ratio, and watch what happens to that ratio as the time that we use gets smaller and smaller and smaller. In other words, take a limit of the distance travelled divided by the time required, as the time taken gets smaller and smaller, _ad infinitum_. This idea was invented by Newton and by Leibniz, independently, and is the beginning of a new branch of mathematics, called the _differential calculus_. Calculus was invented in order to describe motion, and its first application was to the problem of defining what is meant by going “60 miles an hour.”

    - the meaning of a word, phrase, sentence, or text.
- Let us try to define velocity a little better. Suppose that in a short time, `ϵ`, the car or other body goes a short distance xx; then the velocity, `v`, is defined as :
- $v = x/ϵ$
- an approximation that becomes better and better as the `ϵ` is taken smaller and smaller. If a mathematical expression is desired, we can say that the velocity equals the limit as the `ϵ` is made to go smaller and smaller in the expression `x/ϵ`
$$v=\lim_{\epsilon\to0}\frac{x}{\epsilon}$$
##### 8–3Speed as a derivative
$$v=\lim_{Δt\to0}\frac{Δs}{Δt}$$
- This Δt means “an extra bit of t,” and carries an implication that it can be made smaller. defines a time increment, and reminds us of its special character. ΔsΔs has an analogous meaning for the distance ss. Since Δ is not a factor, it cannot be cancelled in the ratio Δs/Δt to give s/t
- showing that something is changing, and it keeps track of what is changing.
- Physicists like to write it `ds=v dt`, because by dtdt they mean Δt in circumstances in which it is very small; with this understanding, the expression is valid to a close approximation. If Δt is too long, the velocity might change during the interval, and the approximation would become less accurate.
- $$v=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}=\frac {ds}{dt}$$
- The quantity `ds/dt` which we found above is called the “derivative of s with respect to t” the complicated process of finding it is called finding a derivative, or differentiating. The ds’s and dt’s which appear separately are called _differentials_.
- There are many rules or formulas for differentiating various types of functions. These can be memorized, or can be found in tables. A short list is found in Table [8–3](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_08.html#Ch8-T3). 
##### 8–4Distance as an integral

| t (sec) | v (ft/sec) |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 0       | 0          |
| 1       | 32         |
| 2       | 64         |

- “In the first second her speed was such and such, and from the formula `Δs=vΔt` we can calculate how far the car went the first second at that speed.” Now in the next second her speed is nearly the same, but slightly different; we can calculate how far she went in the next second by taking the new speed times the time. We proceed similarly for each second, to the end of the run. We now have a number of little distances, and the total distance will be the sum of all these little pieces. That is, the distance will be the sum of the velocities times the times, or $s=\sum v\,\Delta t$ where the Greek letter ∑ (sigma) is used to denote addition. To be more precise, it is the sum of the velocity at a certain time, let us say the i-th time, multiplied by Δt
- $$s=\sum_iv(t_i)\,\Delta t$$
- The rule for the times is that `ti+1=ti+Δt` However, the distance we obtain by this method will not be correct, because the velocity changes during the time interval `Δt`. If we take the times short enough, the sum is precise, so we take them smaller and smaller until we obtain the desired accuracy. The true `s` is
- $$s=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\sum_iv(t_i)\,\Delta t$$
- The mathematicians have invented a symbol for this limit, analogous to the symbol for the differential. The `Δ` turns into a `d` to remind us that the time is as small as it can be; the velocity is then called `v` at the time `t`, and the addition is written as a sum with a great “s,” `∫` (from the Latin _summa_), which has become distorted and is now unfortunately just called an integral sign.
- $$s=\int v(t)\,dt$$
- This process of adding all these terms together is called integration, and it is the opposite process to differentiation. The derivative of this integral is `v`, so one operator (`d`) undoes the other (`∫`). One can get formulas for integrals by taking the formulas for derivatives and running them backwards, because they are related to each other inversely. Thus one can work out his own table of integrals by differentiating all sorts of functions. For every formula with a differential, we get an integral formula if we turn it around.
- Every function can be differentiated analytically, i.e., the process can be carried out algebraically, and leads to a definite function.
#####  8–5Acceleration
-  he next step in developing the equations of motion is to introduce another idea which goes beyond the concept of velocity to that of _change_ of velocity, and we now ask, “How does the velocity _change?_”
- Acceleration is defined as the time rate of change of velocity. From the preceding discussion we know enough already to write the acceleration as the derivative `dv/dt`, in the same way that the velocity is the derivative of the distance.
$$ a=\frac{dv}{dt}=32$$
- This means that the velocity of a falling body is changing by 32 feet per second, per second always. We also see from Table [8–4](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_08.html#Ch8-T4) that the velocity increases by 32 ft/sec in each second. This is a very simple case, for accelerations are usually not constant.
- For reference, we state two very useful formulas, which can be obtained by integration. If a body starts from rest and moves with a constant acceleration, `g`, its velocity `v` at any time `t` is given by $v = gt$
- The distance it covers in the same time is $s=\tfrac{1}{2}gt^2$
- Various mathematical notations are used in writing derivatives. Since velocity is ds/dtds/dt and acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity, we can also write : which are common ways of writing a second derivative.
- $$a=\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{ds}{dt}\biggr)=\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$$
- We have another law that the velocity is equal to the integral of the acceleration. This is just the opposite of `a=dv/dt`; we have already seen that distance is the integral of the velocity, so distance can be found by twice integrating the acceleration.
- Having constructed a table with xx- and yy-distances, how can we determine the velocity? We first find the components of velocity in each direction. The horizontal part of the velocity, or xx-component, is the derivative of the xx-distance with respect to the time, or $v_x =dx/dt$ and y: $v_y =dy/dt$ and z: $v_z =dz/dt$
- $t_2-t_1=\Delta t$
- In the time Δt the particle moves horizontally a distance $Δx≈v_xΔt$ and vertically a distance $Δy≈v_yΔt$. (The symbol “`≈`” is read “is approximately.”) The actual distance moved is approximately
- $$\Delta s\approx\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2}$$
- $$v=\frac{ds}{dt}=\sqrt{(dx/dt)^2+(dy/dt)^2}$$$$=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$$
- $$v=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}$$
- Any object that is shot out - will be a parabola -
#### 9:Newton's Laws of Dynamics-2024-11-16
##### 9-1 Momentum and force
The discovery of the laws of dynamics, or the laws of motion, was a dramatic moment in the history of science. Before Newton’s time, the motions of things like the planets were a mystery, but after Newton there was complete understanding. Even the slight deviations from Kepler’s laws, due to the perturbations of the planets, were computable.
- We can calculate the perturbations on the planet Uranus due to Jupiter and Saturn. After this chapter we _will_ be able to compute not only the motion of the oscillating mass, but also the perturbations on the planet Uranus produced by Jupiter and Saturn!
- Galileo made a great advance in the understanding of motion when he discovered the _principle of inertia_: if an object is left alone, is not disturbed, it continues to move with a constant velocity in a straight line if it was originally moving, or it continues to stand still if it was just standing still. Of course this never appears to be the case in nature, for if we slide a block across a table it stops, but that is because it is _not_ left to itself—it is rubbing against the table. It required a certain imagination to find the right rule, and that imagination was supplied by Galileo.
- the next thing which is needed is a rule for finding how an object _changes_ its speed if something _is_ affecting it. That is, the contribution of Newton. Newton wrote down three laws:
1) The First Law was a mere restatement of the Galilean principle of inertia just described.
2)  The Second Law gave a specific way of determining how the velocity changes under different influences called _forces_.
3) The Third Law describes the forces to some extent, and we shall discuss that at another time.
- Here we shall discuss only the Second Law, which asserts that the motion of an object is changed by forces in this way: _the time-rate-of-change of a quantity called momentum is proportional to the force_.
- _Momentum_ is not the same as _velocity_. A lot of words are used in physics, and they all have precise meanings in physics - we must change the words from “light” and “heavy” to _less massive_ and _more massive_,
- Weight and inertia are _proportional_, and on the earth’s surface are often taken to be numerically equal, which causes a certain confusion to the student. On Mars, weights would be different but the amount of force needed to overcome inertia would be the same.
- We use the term _mass_ as a quantitative measure of inertia,find a certain quantity of mass for every object. Now the _momentum_ of an object is a product of two parts: its _mass_ and its _velocity_
- $F=\frac{d}{dt}(mv)$
- at the beginning we take several things for granted. First, that the mass of an object is _constant_; it isn’t really, but we shall start out with the Newtonian approximation that mass is constant, the same all the time, and that, further, when we put two objects together, their masses _add_.
- Then there are some implications concerning force. As a rough approximation we think of force as a kind of push or pull that we make with our muscles, but we can define it more accurately now that we have this law of motion. The most important thing to realize is that this relationship involves not only changes in the _magnitude_ of the momentum or of the velocity but also in their _direction_. If the mass is constant, then Eq. ([9.1](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_09.html#mjx-eqn-EqI91)) can also be written as
- $F=m\frac{d}{dt}=ma$
- The acceleration aa is the rate of change of the velocity, and Newton’s Second Law says more than that the effect of a given force varies inversely as the mass; it says also that the _direction_ of the change in the velocity and the _direction_ of the force are the same. Thus we must understand that a change in a velocity, or an acceleration, has a wider meaning than in common language: The velocity of a moving object can change by its speeding up, slowing down (when it slows down, we say it accelerates with a negative acceleration)
##### 9-2 Speed and velocity-2024-11-18
- In order to make our language more precise, we shall make one further definition in our use of the words _speed_ and _velocity_. Ordinarily we think of speed and velocity as being the same, and in ordinary language they are the same. But in physics we have taken advantage of the fact that there _are_ two words and have chosen to use them to distinguish two ideas. We carefully distinguish velocity, which has both magnitude and direction, from speed, which we choose to mean the magnitude of the velocity, but which does not include the direction. We can formulate this more precisely by describing how the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of an object change with time.
- Suppose, for example, that at a certain instant an object is moving as shown in Fig. [9–1](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_09.html#Ch9-F1). In a given small interval of time `Δt` it will move a certain distance `Δx` in the x-direction, `Δy` in the y-direction, and `Δz` in the z-direction. The total effect of these three coordinate changes is a displacement `Δs`
	$\Delta x=v_x\,\Delta t,$
	$\Delta y=v_y\,\Delta t,$
	$\Delta z=v_z\,\Delta t.$
- ![[f09-01_tc_big.svg]]
##### 9–3Components of velocity, acceleration, and force
- In Eq. ([9.4](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_09.html#mjx-eqn-EqI94)) _we have resolved the velocity into components_ by telling how fast the object is moving in the x-direction, the y-direction, and the z-direction. The velocity is completely specified, both as to magnitude and direction, if we give the numerical values of its three rectangular components:
	$v_x=dx/dt,$
	$v_y=dy/dt,$
	$v_z=dz/dt.$
- On the other hand, the speed of the object is :
$ds/dt=|v|=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}$
