Last Lecture: 07

Remember, this is where we were at in the 1960's, when the lectures were given, we haven't progressed anywhere since then, this is STILL what they teach - I want to get into Electrical Engineering, but I am gatekept because we don't do apprenticeships any longer and I need a piece of paper to prove I am competent, a degrEE. Coding is a skill, which I now have to compete with half the world with, some dude in punjab who hadn't seen a computer until his early 20's somehow has a masters degree in CompSci, and is, according to jboomer standards, technically more employable than me. I also now have to compete with billions of people and AI for the new labor arbitrage. I want to build cool sh!t, but can't without having a piece of paper. This seemed(seaned?) like a good place to start. Covid cultists/branch covidians kicked me out of university for not worshipping at the church of big pharma/big govt/TV and drinking the kool aid flavored mystery $cience juice. I was right, again, for years, and punished for it, I'm years behind, AGAIN, because you idiots lied to me-I think the count is almost 3 decades at this point that you idiots have stolen from me(and that is just time, not counting half my income in taxes/inflateSean/lost opportunity cost/rule of 72/forced me to pay into a ponzi scheme(P < P + I)/etc - you are all so deeply negative, I genuinely don't see how you are climbing out of that hole), where is my remuneraSean? My grievances aren't sean as legitimate. At least I don't have to wonder everytime I get chest pain if that was because I took the fauci ouchie or if it was from the burrito I ate for lunch. I still haven't received one apology. They really don't think they are responsible for their own actions. Poison the kids to save grandma, because the TV told me to. Do you guys understand how people are going to look back on this time? Like lobotomies, or leeches in the middle ages. Tyrants are useless without the wall of idiots who follow everything they say. At least now I know how to code, and can work anywhere in the world remotely now with my new skill, if the idiots wanna FA again, they FO when I leave to countries who aren't majority populated by brainwashed insane people, who think that as long as they are the majority, they must be right. Nope, just makes alot(ALOT-86% at last count) of idiots, who then attack the people who don't think like them, this is why they are called NPC's, incapable of self-reflectSean. Move on to the next current thing, forget about the last current thing, and do it all again. It's all so tiresome.

- triphosphate = special energy carrying molecules
- muscle can not contract without ATP
- Pain response is ions - 
- acetylcholine(ACh) = brain -> body impulse

- 'mathematics is not a science, it's an unnatural science'
- 'if something isn't "science" it isn't neccesarily bad, love, for instance' 
- DNA and RNA - protein synthesis - deoxyribonucleic acid
- Helium was an element that was discovered on a star before it was discovered on earth
- since everything is made out of atoms, everything is physics (atomism)
- enzymes were originally known as ferments discovered when fermenting sugar
- in the presence of an enzyme a reaction will happen - a catalyst for the reaction
- all enzymes are proteins, but not all proteins are enzymes
- Amino Acids - 20 different types, all form chains - 
- proteins are nothing but chains of the 20 different amino acids put together 'R groups'
- hemoglobin = 56/60? amino acids
- DNA is the blueprint for the enzymes - able to reproduce itself and instruct the proteins - pair of chains '2 ChainZ', twisted, series of sugars and phosphate groups, -Adenine Thiamine Guanine Cytosine - complementary
- mitosis - grow bigger, divide in half 
- microsomes - where proteins are made -from pieces of DNA
- astronomy predates physics - motion of the planets and stars was the beginning of physics - the same thing found in the stars can be found on earth
- geology - how the surface of the earth got the way it was - techtonic plates - earthquakes/volcanoes aren't understood - 'currents inside the earth' - 'we know less about the earth than we do the planets'
- @44:30 - 'psychoanalysis is not a science, it's a medical business, it's like witchdoctory, it has a theory as to what causes disease, lots of different spirits... ' - Based, and psycho-the-rapist pilled. 'when you get sick, you should still go to the witchdoctor, because he knows the most about the sickness' 'it has not been checked by experiment carefully..'
- if an animal learns something, he can do something different, where is he different inside? we do not know where to look or what changes when a fact is learned, this has not been solved at all
- limitations of physics : the HQ? The historical question, how did it get that way? the unmoved mover, the prime mover, initial conditions, astronomical history, formation of stars/elements - how did the laws of physics get that way? are they changing with time? was the sun always yellow? white? etc - over 100 years, noone has been able to figure out = the analysis of circulating/turbulant fluids -> convection, we can figure out X, but can't figure out the weather - first principles - how much pressure to push a fluid out of a pipe
- 'the whole universe is in a glass of wine' - some poet, likely an alcoholic - all life is fermentASean
#### 4:Conservation of Energy-2024-11-02
- RefractSean: without breaking the law of conservation of energy, how does light slow down and then speed up again when changing mediums? (from air -> water -> air :) who is giving muh photons the energy to speed up, again, without breaking the law of conservation of energy, does zombie einstein roll out of his shallow grave to push every particle back up to full speed again? Vs wave particle duality - we don't even kNOw what we don't know - PerturbASean
- there is no exception to this law 'there is a certain quantity of energy, that doesn't change in the manifold nature change that it undergoes' - a mathematical principle - the quantity doesn't change' - if they can't add it all together and find the missing energy they just create another variable, '"ah yes, that's where it went, to X, balance in all things"'
- energy can neither be created nor be destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another
- Perpetual motion does not exist - weight machines
- Potential Energy / Gravitational Potential energy / Electrical Potential Energy = general principle is that the Force x Distance(F times D) that it is moved is the change in energy 
- Gravitational Potential Energy = (weight) * (height)
- Change in ergu = (force) * (distance force acts through)
- ###### For below image and after, I clicked and dragged the SVG from 'https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_04.html' - but I don't actually see a SVG file in obsidian, and when I save it to github, it gives me an empty link and not a SVG file, I can see the SVG files now, currently, but no idea where they are being saved locally if they are at all, so I have no idea how the image SVG's are being referenced, so if they disapear, I got them from the website, future sean. 
- ![[f04-01_tc_big.svg]]
- How much weight is required to move the 1 pound weight and balance it on the (3,4,5 triangle)? 
- ![[f04-03_tc_big_b.svg]]
-  In high school we learned a lot of laws about pulleys and levers used in different ways. We can now see that these “laws” are all the same thing, and that we did not have to memorize 75 rules to figure it out.
- Energy is Sum of Several "Forms" (or ways of calculating)(or ways of calculating).
- principle of virtual work - in order to do the work, you had to imagine the work and small amounts of motion to figure it out
- ![[f04-05_tc_big.svg]]
- Kinetic Energy
- ![[f04-07_tc_big.svg]]
- conversion of gravitational energy into some other form 
- velocity: K.E.=WH (kinetic energy = weight * height)
- K.E.=WV2/2g (Kinetic energy = Weight * Velocity squared / 2) = This is the formula for figuring out the height an object with velocity can go to then do the weight * height calculation - both of these formulas are approximate and relativistic 
- gravitational constant = squared '/2'
- Elastic energy. = If we pull down on a spring, we must do some work, for when we have it down, we can lift weights with it. Therefore in its stretched condition it has a possibility of doing some work. If we were to evaluate the sums of weights times heights, it would not check out—we must add something else to account for the fact that the spring is under tension. Elastic energy is the formula for a spring when it is stretched. How much energy is it? If we let go, the elastic energy, as the spring passes through the equilibrium point, is converted to kinetic energy and it goes back and forth between compressing or stretching the spring and kinetic energy of motion.
- heat energy = t, the spring or the lever is _warmer_, and that there is really an increase of kinetic energy by a definite amount. We call this form of energy _heat energy_, but we know that it is not really a new form, it is just kinetic energy—internal motion. (One of the difficulties with all these experiments with matter that we do on a large scale is that we cannot really demonstrate the conservation of energy and we cannot really make our reversible machines, because every time we move a large clump of stuff, the atoms do not remain absolutely undisturbed, and so a certain amount of random motion goes into the atomic system. We cannot see it, but we can measure it with thermometers - Entropy - Prigogine
- electrical energy = which has to do with pushing and pulling by electric charges.
- radiant energy = the energy of light, which we know is a form of electrical energy because light can be represented as wigglings in the electromagnetic field.
- chemical energy = the energy which is released in chemical reactions.
- elastic energy is, to a certain extent, like chemical energy, because chemical energy is the energy of the attraction of the atoms, one for the other, and so is elastic energy
- nuclear energy = the energy which is involved with the arrangement of particles inside the nucleus
- conservation of linear momentum. = associated in quantum mechanics with the proposition that it makes no difference where you do the experiment, the results will always be the same.
- conservation of angular momentum. = 
- You may have heard that photons come out in blobs and that the energy of a photon is - Planck’s constant times the frequency. That is true, but since the frequency of light can be anything, there is no law that says that energy has to be a certain definite amount
- Conservation of charge =  and that merely means that you count how many positive, minus how many negative electrical charges you have, and the number is never changed. You may get rid of a positive with a negative, but you do not create any net excess of positives over negatives.
- conservation of baryons = There are a number of strange particles, a neutron and a proton are examples, which are called baryons. In any reaction whatever in nature, if we count how many baryons are coming into a process, the number of baryon
- conservation of leptons =We can say that the group of particles called leptons are: electron, muon, and neutrino. There is an antielectron which is a positron, that is, a −1 lepton. Counting the total number of leptons in a reaction reveals that the number in and out never changes, at least so far as we know at present.
- These are the six conservation laws, three of them subtle, involving space and time, and three of them simple, in the sense of counting something.
-  The laws which govern how much energy is available are called the laws of thermodynamics and involve a concept called entropy for irreversible thermodynamic processes.
- . Our supplies of energy are from the sun, rain, coal, uranium, and hydrogen. The sun makes the rain, and the coal also, so that all these are from the sun.
-  If it can be controlled in thermonuclear reactions, it turns out that the energy that can be obtained from 10 quarts of water per second is equal to all of the electrical power generated in the United States. With 150 gallons of running water a minute, you have enough fuel to supply all the energy which is used in the United States today! Therefore it is up to the physicist to figure out how to liberate us from the need for having energy. It can be done.
#### 5:Time and Distance-2024-11-04
- Galileo did an experiment on motion which was essentially this: He allowed a ball to roll down an inclined trough and observed the motion. He did not, however, just look; he measured how far the ball went in how long a time
- Galileo’s first experiments on motion were done by using his pulse to count off equal intervals of time - We may count off beats of a pulse as the ball rolls down the track: “one … two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight …”  = the location of the ball is marked at 1, 2, 3, 4, … units of time from the instant of its release, those marks are distant from the starting point in proportion to the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, … Today we would say the distance is proportional to the square of the time
- What _is_ time? It would be nice if we could find a good definition of time. Webster defines “a time” as “a period,” and the latter as “a time"  - time is one of the things we probably cannot define (in the dictionary sense), and just say that it is what we already know it to be: it is how long we wait! What really matters anyway is not how we _define_ time, but how we measure it. One way of measuring time is to utilize something which happens over and over again in a regular fashion—something which is _periodic_. For example, a day. With an hour glass, we can “create” a periodic occurrence if we have someone standing by it day and night to turn it over whenever the last grain of sand runs out. We could then count the turnings of the glass from each morning to the next. We would find, this time, that the number of “hours” (i.e., turnings of the glass) was not the same each “day.” We should distrust the sun, or the glass, or both.
- we can measure it, yet not define it, show me 'a time' , seconds are a unit of measurement not 'time'
- electron-beam oscilloscope, which acts as a sort of microscope for short times. This device plots on a fluorescent screen a graph of electrical current (or voltage) versus time. By connecting the oscilloscope to two of our oscillators in sequence, so that it plots a graph first of the current in one of our oscillators and then of the current in the other, we get two graphs like those shown
- When we cannot count the years for the measurement of long times, we must look for other ways to measure. One of the most successful is the use of radioactive material as a “clock.” In this case we do not have a periodic occurrence, as for the day or the pendulum, but a new kind of “regularity.” We find that the radioactivity of a particular sample of material decreases by the same _fraction_ for successive equal increases in its age. 
- There are, fortunately, cases in which we can know the amount of radioactivity that was in an object when it was formed. We know, for example, that the carbon dioxide in the air contains a certain small fraction of the radioactive carbon isotope C14 (replenished continuously by the action of cosmic rays). If we measure the _total_ carbon content of an object, we know that a certain fraction of that amount was originally the radioactive C14; we know, therefore, the starting amount A to use in the formula above. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5000 years. By careful measurements we can measure the amount left after 2020 half-lives or so and can therefore “date” organic objects which grew as long as 100,000 years ago.
- When the uranium disintegrates, it changes into lead.
- ![[t05-01_tc_big.svg]]
- How does one subdivide distance? In the same way that we subdivided time: we take a smaller unit and count the number of such units it takes to make up the longer unit.
- PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM A2+B2=C2 : distance can be measured in another fashion: by triangulation. Although this means that we are really using a different definition of distance, when they can both be used they agree with each other. Space is more or less what Euclid thought it was
- able to use triangulation to measure the height of the first Sputnik. We found that it was roughly 5×10(5 exponent) meters high. By more careful measurements the distance to the moon can be measured in the same way. Two telescopes at different places on the earth can give us the two angles we need. It has been found in this way that the moon is 4×10(8 exponent) meters away.
- The distance of nearby stars can be measured by triangulation, using the diameter of the earth’s orbit as a baseline.
- we can mark off a thousand equal subdivisions of the millimeter to make a scale of microns (millionths of a meter). It is difficult to continue to smaller scales, because we cannot “see” objects smaller than the wavelength of visible light (about 5×10(−7 exponent) meter).
-  With an electron microscope, we can continue the process by making photographs on a still smaller scale, say down to 10(−8 exponent) from an observation of the way light of short wavelength (x-radiation) is reflected from a pattern of marks of known separation, we determine the wavelength of the light vibrations. Then, from the pattern of the scattering of the same light from a crystal, we can determine the relative location of the atoms in the crystal, obtaining results which agree with the atomic spacings also determined by chemical means
- ![[t05-02_tc_big.svg]]
- atoms are 99.9999999999996% empty space - 
- Measurements of distance and of time give results which depend on the observer. Two observers moving with respect to each other will not measure the same distances and times when measuring what appear to be the same things. Distances and time intervals have different magnitudes, depending on the coordinate system (or “frame of reference”) used for making the measurements. 
#### 6:Probability-2024-11-05
- By _chance_, we mean something like a guess. Why do we make guesses? We make guesses when we wish to make a judgment but have incomplete information or uncertain knowledge.
-  Any physical theory is a kind of guesswork. There are good guesses and there are bad guesses. The theory of probability is a system for making better guesses.
- We speak of probability only for observations that we contemplate being made in the future. _By the “probability” of a particular outcome of an observation we mean our estimate for the most likely fraction of a number of repeated observations that will yield that particular outcome_.
- In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a mathematical law that states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists. More formally, the LLN states that given a sample of independent and identically distributed values, the sample mean converges to the true mean. - the more times you do something, the more likely it is going to be closer to the probability 
- In Chapter [5](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_05.html) we described the size of a nucleus in terms of its apparent area, or “cross section.” When we did so we were really talking about probabilities. When we shoot a high-energy particle at a thin slab of material, there is some chance that it will pass right through and some chance that it will hit a nucleus.
- Raisin Bun model 'Bohr Rutherford'
- higgs boson gives me a hadron
- The number of “ways” to any point on the diagram is just the number of different “paths” (sequences of heads and tails) which can be taken from the starting point. The vertical position gives us the total number of heads thrown. The set of numbers which appears in such a diagram is known as _Pascal’s triangle_ Vs Wager. The numbers are also known as the _binomial coefficients_
- brownian motion = motion of atoms - the motion of a molecule, or of any particle, in a gas is like a random walk. Suppose we open a bottle of an organic compound and let some of its vapor escape into the air. If there are air currents, so that the air is circulating, the currents will also carry the vapor with them. But even in _perfectly still air_, the vapor will gradually spread out—will diffuse—until it has penetrated throughout the room.
- [Δx]⋅[Δv]≥ℏ/2m = This equation is a statement of the _Heisenberg uncertainty principle_ that we mentioned earlier.The uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must exist in any attempt to describe nature. Our most precise description of nature _must_ be in terms of _probabilities_.
- Einstein was quite worried about this problem. He used to shake his head and say, “But, surely God does not throw dice in determining how electrons should go!”
- our best “picture” of a hydrogen atom is a nucleus surrounded by an “electron cloud” (although we _really_ mean a “probability cloud”). The electron is there somewhere, but nature permits us to know only the _chance_ of finding it at any particular place.
- In its efforts to learn as much as possible about nature, modern physics has found that certain things can never be “known” with certainty. Much of our knowledge must always remain uncertain. The _most_ we can know is in terms of probabilities.
#### 7:The Theory of Gravitation-2024-11-06
- In this chapter we shall discuss one of the most far-reaching generalizations of the human mind. While we are admiring the human mind, we should take some time off to stand in awe of a _nature_ that could follow with such completeness and generality such an elegantly simple principle as the law of gravitation. What is this law of gravitation? It is that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which for any two bodies is proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of the distance between them. This statement can be expressed mathematically by the equation
- $F=G\frac{mm}{{r}{2}}$
- If to this we add the fact that an object responds to a force by accelerating in the direction of the force by an amount that is inversely proportional to the mass of the object, we shall have said everything required, for a sufficiently talented mathematician could then deduce all the consequences of these two principles
- The story begins with the ancients observing the motions of planets among the stars, and finally deducing that they went around the sun, a fact that was rediscovered later by Copernicus. Exactly _how_ the planets went around the sun, with exactly _what motion_, took a little more work to discover. Beginning in the sixteenth century there were great debates as to whether they really went around the sun or not. Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients: his idea was that these debates about the nature of the motions of the planets would best be resolved if the actual positions of the planets in the sky were measured sufficiently accurately. If measurement showed exactly how the planets moved, then perhaps it would be possible to establish one or another viewpoint. This was a tremendous idea—that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. Pursuing this idea, Tycho Brahe studied the positions of the planets for many years in his observatory on the island of Hven, near Copenhagen. He made voluminous tables, which were then studied by the mathematician Kepler, after Tycho’s death. Kepler discovered from the data some very beautiful and remarkable, but simple, laws regarding planetary motion.
