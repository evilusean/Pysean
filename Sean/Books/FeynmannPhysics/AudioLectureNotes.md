Last Lecture: 4

Remember, this is where we were at in the 1960's, when the lectures were given, we haven't progressed anywhere since then, this is STILL what they teach - I want to get into Electrical Engineering, but I am gatekept because we don't do apprenticeships any longer and I need a piece of paper to prove I am competent, a degrEE. Coding is a skill, which I now have to compete with half the world with, some dude in punjab who hadn't seen a computer until his early 20's somehow has a masters degree in CompSci, and is, according to jboomer standards, technically more employable than me. I also now have to compete with billions of people and AI for the new labor arbitrage. I want to build cool sh!t, but can't without having a piece of paper. This seemed(seaned?) like a good place to start. Covid cultists/branch covidians kicked me out of university for not worshipping at the church of big pharma/big govt/TV and drinking the kool aid flavored mystery $cience juice. I was right, again, for years, and punished for it, I'm years behind, AGAIN, because you idiots lied to me-I think the count is almost 3 decades at this point that you idiots have stolen from me(and that is just time, not counting half my income in taxes/inflateSean/lost opportunity cost/rule of 72/forced me to pay into a ponzi scheme(P < P + I)/etc - you are all so deeply negative, I genuinely don't see how you are climbing out of that hole), where is my remuneraSean? My grievances aren't sean as legitimate. At least I don't have to wonder everytime I get chest pain if that was because I took the fauci ouchie or if it was from the burrito I ate for lunch. I still haven't received one apology. They really don't think they are responsible for their own actions. Poison the kids to save grandma, because the TV told me to. Do you guys understand how people are going to look back on this time? Like lobotomies, or leeches in the middle ages. Tyrants are useless without the wall of idiots who follow everything they say. At least now I know how to code, and can work anywhere in the world remotely now with my new skill, if the idiots wanna FA again, they FO when I leave to countries who aren't majority populated by brainwashed insane people, who think that as long as they are the majority, they must be right. Nope, just makes alot(ALOT-86% at last count) of idiots, who then attack the people who don't think like them, this is why they are called NPC's, incapable of self-reflectSean. Move on to the next current thing, forget about the last current thing, and do it all again. It's all so tiresome. 
#### 1:Atoms in motion-2024-10-30
- didn't take notes, wasn't thinking about obsidian, was lying down listening to lectures
#### 2:Basic Physics-2024-10-30
- forgot to take notes
#### 3:The relation of physics to other sciences-2024-10-31
- statistical mechanics - thermodynamics
- organic chemistry - living chemistry - biology - common with life = cells within cells
- sucrose photosynthesis vs breathe similarity krebs cycle ATP(adenosine triphosphate) - GDP(guanasine diphosphate) -> ADTP/G3TP(guanosine triphosphate) 
- triphosphate = special energy carrying molecules
- muscle can not contract without ATP
- Pain response is ions - 
- acetylcholine(ACh) = brain -> body impulse
-  sodium(3) potassium(2) ions - 'pump' for nerves to carry message 'impulse'
- 'mathematics is not a science, it's an unnatural science'
- 'if something isn't "science" it isn't neccesarily bad, love, for instance' 
- DNA and RNA - protein synthesis - deoxyribonucleic acid
- Helium was an element that was discovered on a star before it was discovered on earth
- since everything is made out of atoms, everything is physics (atomism)
- enzymes were originally known as ferments discovered when fermenting sugar
- in the presence of an enzyme a reaction will happen - a catalyst for the reaction
- all enzymes are proteins, but not all proteins are enzymes
- Amino Acids - 20 different types, all form chains - 
- proteins are nothing but chains of the 20 different amino acids put together 'R groups'
- hemoglobin = 56/60? amino acids
- DNA is the blueprint for the enzymes - able to reproduce itself and instruct the proteins - pair of chains '2 ChainZ', twisted, series of sugars and phosphate groups, -Adenine Thiamine Guanine Cytosine - complementary
- mitosis - grow bigger, divide in half 
- microsomes - where proteins are made -from pieces of DNA
- astronomy predates physics - motion of the planets and stars was the beginning of physics - the same thing found in the stars can be found on earth
- geology - how the surface of the earth got the way it was - techtonic plates - earthquakes/volcanoes aren't understood - 'currents inside the earth' - 'we know less about the earth than we do the planets'
- @44:30 - 'psychoanalysis is not a science, it's a medical business, it's like witchdoctory, it has a theory as to what causes disease, lots of different spirits... ' - Based, and psycho-the-rapist pilled. 'when you get sick, you should still go to the witchdoctor, because he knows the most about the sickness' 'it has not been checked by experiment carefully..'
- if an animal learns something, he can do something different, where is he different inside? we do not know where to look or what changes when a fact is learned, this has not been solved at all
- limitations of physics : the HQ? The historical question, how did it get that way? the unmoved mover, the prime mover, initial conditions, astronomical history, formation of stars/elements - how did the laws of physics get that way? are they changing with time? was the sun always yellow? white? etc - over 100 years, noone has been able to figure out = the analysis of circulating/turbulant fluids -> convection, we can figure out X, but can't figure out the weather - first principles - how much pressure to push a fluid out of a pipe
- 'the whole universe is in a glass of wine' - some poet, likely an alcoholic - all life is fermentASean
#### 4:Conservation of Energy-2024-11-02
- RefractSean: without breaking the law of conservation of energy, how does light slow down and then speed up again when changing mediums? (from air -> water -> air :) who is giving muh photons the energy to speed up, again, without breaking the law of conservation of energy, does zombie einstein roll out of his shallow grave to push every particle back up to full speed again? Vs wave particle duality - we don't even kNOw what we don't know - PerturbASean
- there is no exception to this law 'there is a certain quantity of energy, that doesn't change in the manifold nature change that it undergoes' - a mathematical principle - the quantity doesn't change' - if they can't add it all together and find the missing energy they just create another variable, '"ah yes, that's where it went, to X, balance in all things"'
- energy can neither be created nor be destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another
- Perpetual motion does not exist - weight machines
- Potential Energy / Gravitational Potential energy / Electrical Potential Energy = general principle is that the Force x Distance(F times D) that it is moved is the change in energy 
- Gravitational Potential Energy = (weight) * (height)
- Change in ergu = (force) * (distance force acts through)
- ###### For below image and after, I clicked and dragged the SVG from 'https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_04.html' - but I don't actually see a SVG file in obsidian, and when I save it to github, it gives me an empty link and not a SVG file, I can see the SVG files now, currently, but no idea where they are being saved locally if they are at all, so I have no idea how the image SVG's are being referenced, so if they disapear, I got them from the website, future sean. 
- ![[f04-01_tc_big.svg]]
- How much weight is required to move the 1 pound weight and balance it on the (3,4,5 triangle)? 
- ![[f04-03_tc_big_b.svg]]
-  In high school we learned a lot of laws about pulleys and levers used in different ways. We can now see that these “laws” are _all the same thing_, and that we did not have to memorize 75 rules to figure it out.
- Energy is Sum of Several "Forms" (or ways of calculating)(or ways of calculating).
- principle of virtual work - in order to do the work, you had to imagine the work and small amounts of motion to figure it out
- ![[f04-05_tc_big.svg]]
- Kinetic Energy
- ![[f04-07_tc_big.svg]]
- conversion of gravitational energy into some other form 
- velocity: K.E.=WH (kinetic energy = weight * height)
- K.E.=WV2/2g (Kinetic energy = Weight * Velocity squared / 2) = This is the formula for figuring out the height an object with velocity can go to then do the weight * height calculation - both of these formulas are approximate and relativistic 
- gravitational constant = squared '/2'
- Elastic energy. = If we pull down on a spring, we must do some work, for when we have it down, we can lift weights with it. Therefore in its stretched condition it has a possibility of doing some work. If we were to evaluate the sums of weights times heights, it would not check out—we must add something else to account for the fact that the spring is under tension. Elastic energy is the formula for a spring when it is stretched. How much energy is it? If we let go, the elastic energy, as the spring passes through the equilibrium point, is converted to kinetic energy and it goes back and forth between compressing or stretching the spring and kinetic energy of motion.
- heat energy = t, the spring or the lever is _warmer_, and that there is really an increase of kinetic energy by a definite amount. We call this form of energy _heat energy_, but we know that it is not really a new form, it is just kinetic energy—internal motion. (One of the difficulties with all these experiments with matter that we do on a large scale is that we cannot really demonstrate the conservation of energy and we cannot really make our reversible machines, because every time we move a large clump of stuff, the atoms do not remain absolutely undisturbed, and so a certain amount of random motion goes into the atomic system. We cannot see it, but we can measure it with thermometers - Entropy - Prigogine
- electrical energy = which has to do with pushing and pulling by electric charges.
- radiant energy = the energy of light, which we know is a form of electrical energy because light can be represented as wigglings in the electromagnetic field.
- chemical energy = the energy which is released in chemical reactions.
- elastic energy is, to a certain extent, like chemical energy, because chemical energy is the energy of the attraction of the atoms, one for the other, and so is elastic energy
- nuclear energy = the energy which is involved with the arrangement of particles inside the nucleus
- conservation of linear momentum. = associated in quantum mechanics with the proposition that it makes no difference where you do the experiment, the results will always be the same.
- conservation of angular momentum. = 
- You may have heard that photons come out in blobs and that the energy of a photon is - Planck’s constant times the frequency. That is true, but since the frequency of light can be anything, there is no law that says that energy has to be a certain definite amount
- Conservation of charge =  and that merely means that you count how many positive, minus how many negative electrical charges you have, and the number is never changed. You may get rid of a positive with a negative, but you do not create any net excess of positives over negatives.
- conservation of baryons = There are a number of strange particles, a neutron and a proton are examples, which are called baryons. In any reaction whatever in nature, if we count how many baryons are coming into a process, the number of baryon
- conservation of leptons =We can say that the group of particles called leptons are: electron, muon, and neutrino. There is an antielectron which is a positron, that is, a −1 lepton. Counting the total number of leptons in a reaction reveals that the number in and out never changes, at least so far as we know at present.
- These are the six conservation laws, three of them subtle, involving space and time, and three of them simple, in the sense of counting something.
-  The laws which govern how much energy is available are called the laws of thermodynamics and involve a concept called entropy for irreversible thermodynamic processes.
- . Our supplies of energy are from the sun, rain, coal, uranium, and hydrogen. The sun makes the rain, and the coal also, so that all these are from the sun.
-  If it can be controlled in thermonuclear reactions, it turns out that the energy that can be obtained from 10 quarts of water per second is equal to all of the electrical power generated in the United States. With 150 gallons of running water a minute, you have enough fuel to supply all the energy which is used in the United States today! Therefore it is up to the physicist to figure out how to liberate us from the need for having energy. It can be done.
