Last Lecture: 4

Remember, this is where we were at in the 1960's, when the lectures were given, we haven't progressed anywhere since then, this is STILL what they teach - I want to get into Electrical Engineering, but I am gatekept because we don't do apprenticeships any longer and I need a piece of paper to prove I am competent, a degrEE. Coding is a skill, which I now have to compete with half the world with, some dude in punjab who hadn't seen a computer until his early 20's somehow has a masters degree in CompSci, and is, according to jboomer standards, technically more employable than me. I also now have to compete with billions of people and AI for the new labor arbitrage. I want to build cool sh!t, but can't without having a piece of paper. This seemed(seaned?) like a good place to start. Covid cultists/branch covidians kicked me out of university for not worshipping at the church of big pharma/big govt/TV and drinking the kool aid flavored mystery $cience juice. I was right, again, for years, and punished for it, I'm years behind, AGAIN, because you idiots lied to me-I think the count is almost 3 decades at this point that you idiots have stolen from me(and that is just time, not counting half my income in taxes/inflateSean/lost opportunity cost/rule of 72/forced me to pay into a ponzi scheme(P < P + I)/etc - you are all so deeply negative, I genuinely don't see how you are climbing out of that hole), where is my remuneraSean? My grievances aren't sean as legitimate. At least I don't have to wonder everytime I get chest pain if that was because I took the fauci ouchie or if it was from the burrito I ate for lunch. I still haven't received one apology. They really don't think they are responsible for their own actions. Poison the kids to save grandma, because the TV told me to. Do you guys understand how people are going to look back on this time? Like lobotomies, or leeches in the middle ages. Tyrants are useless without the wall of idiots who follow everything they say. At least now I know how to code, and can work anywhere in the world remotely now with my new skill, if the idiots wanna FA again, they FO when I leave to countries who aren't majority populated by brainwashed insane people, who think that as long as they are the majority, they must be right. Nope, just makes alot(ALOT-86% at last count) of idiots, who then attack the people who don't think like them, this is why they are called NPC's, incapable of self-reflectSean. Move on to the next current thing, forget about the last current thing, and do it all again. It's all so tiresome. 
#### 1:Atoms in motion-2024-10-30
- didn't take notes, wasn't thinking about obsidian, was lying down listening to lectures
#### 2:Basic Physics-2024-10-30
- forgot to take notes
#### 3:The relation of physics to other sciences-2024-10-31
- statistical mechanics - thermodynamics
- organic chemistry - living chemistry - biology - common with life = cells within cells
- sucrose photosynthesis vs breathe similarity krebs cycle ATP(adenosine triphosphate) - GDP(guanasine diphosphate) -> ADTP/G3TP(guanosine triphosphate) 
- triphosphate = special energy carrying molecules
- muscle can not contract without ATP
- Pain response is ions - 
- acetylcholine(ACh) = brain -> body impulse
-  sodium(3) potassium(2) ions - 'pump' for nerves to carry message 'impulse'
- 'mathematics is not a science, it's an unnatural science'
- 'if something isn't "science" it isn't neccesarily bad, love, for instance' 
- DNA and RNA - protein synthesis - deoxyribonucleic acid
- Helium was an element that was discovered on a star before it was discovered on earth
- since everything is made out of atoms, everything is physics (atomism)
- enzymes were originally known as ferments discovered when fermenting sugar
- in the presence of an enzyme a reaction will happen - a catalyst for the reaction
- all enzymes are proteins, but not all proteins are enzymes
- Amino Acids - 20 different types, all form chains - 
- proteins are nothing but chains of the 20 different amino acids put together 'R groups'
- hemoglobin = 56/60? amino acids
- DNA is the blueprint for the enzymes - able to reproduce itself and instruct the proteins - pair of chains '2 ChainZ', twisted, series of sugars and phosphate groups, -Adenine Thiamine Guanine Cytosine - complementary
- mitosis - grow bigger, divide in half 
- microsomes - where proteins are made -from pieces of DNA
- astronomy predates physics - motion of the planets and stars was the beginning of physics - the same thing found in the stars can be found on earth
- geology - how the surface of the earth got the way it was - techtonic plates - earthquakes/volcanoes aren't understood - 'currents inside the earth' - 'we know less about the earth than we do the planets'
- @44:30 - 'psychoanalysis is not a science, it's a medical business, it's like witchdoctory, it has a theory as to what causes disease, lots of different spirits... ' - Based, and psycho-the-rapist pilled. 'when you get sick, you should still go to the witchdoctor, because he knows the most about the sickness' 'it has not been checked by experiment carefully..'
- if an animal learns something, he can do something different, where is he different inside? we do not know where to look or what changes when a fact is learned, this has not been solved at all
- limitations of physics : the HQ? The historical question, how did it get that way? the unmoved mover, the prime mover, initial conditions, astronomical history, formation of stars/elements - how did the laws of physics get that way? are they changing with time? was the sun always yellow? white? etc - over 100 years, noone has been able to figure out = the analysis of circulating/turbulant fluids -> convection, we can figure out X, but can't figure out the weather - first principles - how much pressure to push a fluid out of a pipe
- 'the whole universe is in a glass of wine' - some poet, likely an alcoholic - all life is fermentASean
#### 4:Conservation of Energy-
