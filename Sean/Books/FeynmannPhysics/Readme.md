B! The Feynmann Lectures on Physics - the NEW MILLENIUM EDITION </br>
VOLUME I: MAINLY mechanics, radiation, and heat</br>
Volume II: Mainly electromagnetism and matter</br>
Volume III: Quantum mechanics</br>
Repo Created for Storing all notes on Feynmann's Lectures on Physics - bought the 3 volume copy years ago, I might need to do more than coding/medic and actually will need electronics and should learn a broader breadth+depth.
I started being more curious when I realized I was lied to about damn near everything, and I'm going to have to relearn everything, again, by myself(I did - work in progresSean)</br>
Will use XeLatex for notes, so I can actually save the formulas without it looking weird AF</br>
Will transcribe all of my old notes into this new repo, as well as save all the forumlas</br>
LeftOff Page(where I got to before taking notes last time):15-1 Special Theory of Relativity - Vol I</br>
