# Preamble :
Started reading/listening to Walter Russell's B!'The Universal One' - Heard Terrence Howard did a podcast on this, much easier listening than a book through text to speech - No, I do not '"trust the $cience"' given to me by '"the usual suspects"' with '"einstein"' as founder and foundation, who worked at a patent office/genius inventor(Lol, Lmao) - When I grew up it was the bohr rutherford model with a raisin bun model, '"The $cience $TM$"', has been changed multiple times within my own lifetime, ideas have flipped, what was good, is now bad, and back again. Normies are as fickle as leaves in the wind, being pushed around by '"the media"', being told what and when to care about things even when they have double standards and act like hypocrites while contradicting themselves within the same breath/sentence. Once you see the normies for what they are, you can't unsean it.

- 97 patents
- john keely = frequency - self sustaining engine(pressurized air) - 1872 
- 40.5 Hz = hydrogen same tone as carbon 
- 81 Hz = Carbon
- 162 Hz = Silicon
- 324 Hz = Cobalt
- 648 Hz = Rhodium
- middle point between 2 noble gasses - all of the above
- Colour to sound and back again
- same wavelength, just twice as long, keep dividing light by 2, get back to the audible sound of it
- carbon = bisexual tone = +/- side to it +4/-4
- first one we are able to perceive is hydrogen - too dense
- Lithium+1/Beryllium+2/Boron+3 is contractive 
- Nitrogen -3
- Oxygen -2
- Florine -1
- Florine and Lithium are 'mates' the minute that florine is introduced, if they are bonded with any other element, they will violently seperate/break all bonds - same with beryllium and oxygen - 
- if you want to break water into its component parts - all you need to do is introduce beryllium or the sound of beryllium and oxygen will break away, even hydrogen - this can all be done without electrolysis, without using heat, just through frequency
- Sodium vs Chlorine = equal and opposite mates - chlorine in pool, add some salt to turn into oil - neutralizes eachother - everything has an equal and opposite mate
- sodium becomes potassium in the next octave
- 'Alphanon' 'Betanon' 'Omeganon' - anons, rise up!
- Arsenic(-3) un-alives us, is because DNA has nitrogen and phosphorous
- Isotypes are not true elements -  full tones/spheres vs ellipticals
- Wave conjugations allow us to unravel it - angles of incidence to open these things up
- platonic solids were averages and approximations - show me a real straight line in nature
- everything is in motion, expressed in waves, curved, every action has an equal and opposite reaction - the greater the action, the greater the reaction, the greater the resistance, the greater the curvature - nature is based on equanimity (balance of good and bad) - 
- gravity was caused by electric force, electricity is always seeking a higher pressure condition, next electric wave is coming, gets pushed out through the vortices, 4 magnetic waves that hit eachother at 120 degree angles, reconvert to the electric field, and back to the source, 
- electric returns to source, magnetism expands out at the equator - (?)it's why we get shorter/hunchback as we get older(Psoas) the electric force is pushing in and condensing 
- electron fields are just discharged electricity/refuse/waste product from the sun, hits our magnetic field, then becomes electricity, and pushes itself out at the equator
- '"ein*stein*"' combined both magnetism and electricity
- electricity = contraction/inhale vs magnetism = radiates/exhale
- hot air/cold air move in opposite directions from eachother -same with hot/cold water
- magnets, how do they work? vs ICP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs
- Were the juggalos based and redpilled this entire time? they tried to tell us, and we laughed at the clowns. A conditioned response to the clownerey. Who are the real clowns, now? https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-doctor-i-am-pagliacci
- carbon unwinds and becomes nitrogen, nitrogen unwinds and becomes oxygen - radioactive  material deteriorates into lead - 
- '"einstein"' said on his deathbed, '"I should of spent more time reading Walter Russell's work"'
- Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment 1877 = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment - disproved the aether / fifth element / creatio ex nihilo - creation from nothing / 
- is the glass half empty or half full? False. The glass is filled, half with water, half with air.
- $cientists ignored Russell Walters work because he didn't include any equations, he talked philosophically about it - how things behave - can't mathturbate? DENIED, DISREGARDED, DISCARDED
- wave conjugations/mirror shapes/flower of life(64 circles) vs platonic solids - they added straightlines at the intersection points - there is negative space where they can't touch eachother, electricity tries to get to the center of that triangle 
- electricity seeks a higher pressure condition(? shouldn't this be the opposite - if it is seeking empty space = less pressure?)
- enlil vs enki - enki gave the flower of life
- when 8 bubbles meet - negative space = tetre-en -6 bubbles is a stable structure - 12 is also stable, but 4 unaccounted electrical poles = basis of crystallization - 24 bubbles = another stable structure - negative space triangle
- tetra terryan wave conjugations - predicts distribution of matter Vs platonic solids
- 1 x 1 = 2 (how to trigger a vaxmaxxed black $cience guy aka neil degrass tyson to the point he goes no contact, lol, lmao - Carl Sagan did it better.)
- the square root of a number added to itself equals more than that number squared - the whole is worth more than the sum of its parts(? is this where he was going with that)
- that happens in the $\sqrt{2}$ =
- I had a similar idea about divisean = 1/3 = 33.33333 repeating 2/3 = 66.6666666 3/3 = 99.9999999 - what's missing? the 1. Vs Body(hylics) Mind(Pneumatics) Spirit(Psych) 
- he's parasite pilled, oil of oregano detox vs wormwood - intermittant fasting 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y45oADjAAuQ&ab_channel=SystemOfADown-Topic
- Alan watts had misstresses 
- humans are flawed creatures with vices - he smokes
- flowers don't grow unless you throw some sh!t on it
- treat em like mushrooms, feed em poop, and keep them in the dark.
- Tesla was never respected, he died in poverty, for '"some reason"', AKA '"bankers"'
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS7aYL-1Cv4&ab_channel=LXSTCXNTURY
- We've had this tech for >100 years, but lost it, for '"some reason"'
- Schrodingers Cat Tat
- Heisenberg uncertainty principle
- ElectroMagnetic wave needs a medium - can not be the cause of it's own action - an effect can never be the cause - chicken came before the egg
- Giordono Bruno = Grand Unified Field Equation - unalived by the catholic church - straight lines - hung upside down and set on fire. 
- Larmore -> Thomas Young -> Frenel Lense = Moving Aether with opposing vortices
- earth is drifting away from the sun at 0.6 inches/1.5cm a year = 93 million miles from earth to sun = 9,820,800,000,000 years for earth to get here - mars = 147 million miles away = 15 trillion - theorizes that mars was once where earth is now 'goldilocks zone' and venus is next - asteroid belt was once a planet - 
-  mercury can't expand, like hydrogen - highest pressure possible
- periodic table = these things happen periodically, same substance,  change motion and pressure conditions = changes crystallization, different element but same substance
- our planet doesn't have a solid core, hollow earth, bubble vs CERN - planet popping -speculation
- every sun gives birth to it's own planets - allegedly
- dark matter is a larp to explain galaxy spin
- gravity is an effect of electricity - electric universe?
- 1:05:00 - talking about jibby jab side effects - 300% Cancer/All cause mortality 40%/Pulmonary embolisms 500%/Spikes/BRCA-1 Gene/Ovaries/Lymphs/Bone Marrow/Ace2/ - Never, not once, did I regret not taking it. 
- Bizarre state of human psychology
- they don't have to release any negative studies - 
- ivermectin - dendrites/axioms - nodes - parasite paralysis - interrupts the potassium chloride cycle - SHUT. IT. DOWN.
- how many people(normie vaxcattle) went along with it, and we're angry at the people(not normiecattle) who didn't go along with it - ya'll kicked us out of school, jobs, and wanted to put us in camps, and now they want to gaslight the sentient people that it never happened(Lol, Lmao) - Still haven't received a single f'ing apology, btw. 
- tuskegee/thalidomide - 1920's - syphilis - 60years untreated - when did it become cool to trust for profit big pharma companies/corrupt governments?
- Fundamentals are wrong, 'forgive them, lord, for they know not what they do' 
- 'we are about to unalive gravity, their god gravity' 'maybe you dropped your computer' - Lol, Lmao. 
- linchpin configuration 120 degrees radially, tilit 109.5 degrees,  2 vortices, saturn hexagon, with a ring - all physics simulated, not pre recorded.  - external pressures being applied from the outside in, not the standard model of internal fission reaction with iron cores - universe is not infinite, but finite - shapes is from the wave bouncing on an edge and coming back
- the sun poops, and we get planets. coronal mass ejection - instead of muh big bang
- he's talking about the 100th monkey/jungs theory on collective consciousness, where it's siloed to species - where only a few people need to know something for everyone else to 'get it'/rats in NYC know something from rats in UK - dimorphic resonance
- the secret life of plants - appear static 
- gravity = greater mass = greater attaction vs Balloon + Static electrictity - electricity 137x stronger than gravity - angles of incidence 120 degrees
- the planet is alive and trying to unalive humans, for '"some reason"'
- Terrence DaShon Howard Vs Le SeanDa - Lol, Lmao
- rotation - centripodal spin creates an electric field called gravity
- Theres only 2 directions NorthEast=Right=Electric(going in) and SouthWest=Left=Magnetic(goes out)
- Contracts in 5ths, Expands in 6es
- Tangental Flight - spins around own center of mass
- he had my daisy chain drone idea - sorta - his group up
- hydrogen fuel cells
- less pressure in atmo = expanded nitrogen = 'the bends'
- radioactive decay is higher closer to the sun - pressure conditions
- propulsion projecticle - angles of incidence + electricity - converts water to plasma
- things are heavier at the poles, lighter at equator - plonk scale
- intellectual phase locking - average instead of fluctuations
- galileo - IO(moon) going around jupiter - change in light
- renormalization Vs Dyson Vs Feynmann - ya'll just making sh!t up
-
