Started reading/listening to Walter Russell's B!'The Universal One' - Heard Terrence Howard did a podcast on this, much easier listening than a book through text to speech - No, I do not '"trust the $cience"' given to me by '"the usual suspects"' with '"einstein"' as founder and foundation, who worked at a patent office/genius inventor(Lol, Lmao) - When I grew up it was the bohr rutherford model with a raisin bun model, '"The $cience $TM$"', has been changed multiple times within my own lifetime, ideas have flipped, what was good, is now bad, and back again. Normies are as fickle as leaves in the wind, being pushed around by '"the media"', being told what and when to care about things even when they have double standards and act like hypocrites while contradicting themselves within the same breath/sentence. Once you see the normies for what they are, you can't unsean it.
