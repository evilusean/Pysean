# Preamble :
Started reading/listening to Walter Russell's B!'The Universal One' - Heard Terrence Howard did a podcast on this, much easier listening than a book through text to speech - No, I do not '"trust the $cience"' given to me by '"the usual suspects"' with '"einstein"' as founder and foundation, who worked at a patent office/genius inventor(Lol, Lmao) - When I grew up it was the bohr rutherford model with a raisin bun model, '"The $cience $TM$"', has been changed multiple times within my own lifetime, ideas have flipped, what was good, is now bad, and back again. Normies are as fickle as leaves in the wind, being pushed around by '"the media"', being told what and when to care about things even when they have double standards and act like hypocrites while contradicting themselves within the same breath/sentence. Once you see the normies for what they are, you can't unsean it.

- 97 patents
- john keely = frequency - self sustaining engine(pressurized air) - 1872 
- 40.5 Hz = hydrogen same tone as carbon 
- 81 Hz = Carbon
- 162 Hz = Silicon
- 324 Hz = Cobalt
- 648 Hz = Rhodium
- middle point between 2 noble gasses - all of the above
- Colour to sound and back again
- same wavelength, just twice as long, keep dividing light by 2, get back to the audible sound of it
- carbon = bisexual tone = +/- side to it +4/-4
- first one we are able to perceive is hydrogen - too dense
- Lithium+1/Beryllium+2/Boron+3 is contractive 
- Nitrogen -3
- Oxygen -2
- Florine -1
- Florine and Lithium are 'mates' the minute that florine is introduced, if they are bonded with any other element, they will violently seperate/break all bonds - same with beryllium and oxygen - 
- if you want to break water into its component parts - all you need to do is introduce beryllium or the sound of beryllium and oxygen will break away, even hydrogen - this can all be done without electrolysis, without using heat, just through frequency
- Sodium vs Chlorine = equal and opposite mates - chlorine in pool, add some salt to turn into oil
