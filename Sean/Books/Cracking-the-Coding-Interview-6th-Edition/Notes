Chapter 1: Introduction- Page 16-19====================================================================================================
Virtual Function(C)=A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class.
BST(Binary Search Tree)=Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition, and removal of data items. Since the nodes in a BST are
  laid out so that each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree, the lookup performance is proportional to that of binary logarithm. 
  BSTs were devised in the 1960s for the problem of efficient storage
WhiteBoards=Used for coding interviews for the interviewee to explain their thought process/problem solving skills- Ask questions

II-Behind the Scenes-Page 20-26=========================================================================================================
Personal Interview -> Screening Interview -> Technical Interview
Ask interviewer coordinator their position in the company, the technical interview(coding+algo questions) will be done by an engineer
Some companies will give you homework, or use a synchronized code writing, or on paper and say it over phone, 
Relative Comparisons=You are being compared with the other interviewees, if the problem is hard for you, it is hard for them- its ok to get wrong
After interview if you don't hear back in 3-5 business days, check in politely with your interviewer in a week, or HR-they might be busy
If you fail an interview most will let you apply again in 6-12 months
Normally 3-6 interviews before an offer
Often your interview goes to a hiring commitee with your interviewers feedback where they will decide 'offer' 'more interviews' or 'rejectsean'
Be nice to your interviewer, they can fight for you to be hired or not
Explain your passion for technology, prepare answer, "Why do you want to work for us?" -Mention VS Code for Microsoft, etc
You will only reach the hiring manager if you've done well
Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding,  Experience, and Communication) and you are given an 
  overall score from 1.0 to 4.0
If the hiring committee recommends an offer, your packet will go to a compensation committee and then to the executive management committee. 
  Returning a decision can take several weeks because there are so many stages and committees. 

III-Special Situations-Page 27-37 =========================================================================================================
SDETs =(software design engineers in test), PM=Product Manager ,Dev Lead and Managers
Visas and Work Authorization =Unfortunately, many smaller startups in the U.S. are not able to sponsor work visas. 
People without computer science degrees (or who earned their degrees a long time ago) should focus first on learning the core concepts discussed in this book,
  especially big O time, , binary search tree, breadth-first search, and other important concepts.
Most won't remember Dijkstra's algorithm or the specifics of how AVL trees works. 
Many candidates are poor at articulating their specific accomplishments. 
Not describing the details of the actions they took makes them a flawed candidate, but not necessarily a flawed employee. 
Being a good interview candidate is its own skill
At a very, very high level, there are four modes of questions;
  Sanity Check: These are often easy problem-solving or design questions. They assess a minimum 
    degree of competence in problem-solving. They won't tell distinguish between "okay" versus "great" so 
    don't evaluate them as such. You can use them earfy in the process (to filter out the worst candidates), or 
    when you only need a minimum degree of competency.
  Quality Check: These are the more challenging questions, often in problem-solving or design. They 
    are designed to be rigorous and really make a candidate think. Use these when algorithmic/problemsolving skiils are of high importance. 
    The biggest mistake people make here is asking questions that are, in fact, bad problem-solving questions. 
  Specialist Questions: These questions test knowledge of specific topics, such as Java or machine learning. . If it's easily acquirable,
    then there's no reason to hire for it.
  Proxy Knowledge: This is knowledge that is not quite at the specialist level (in fact, you might not even 
    need it), but that you would expect a candidate at their level to know For example, it might not be very 
    important to you if a candidate knows CSS or HTML. But if a candidate has worked in depth with these 
    technologies and can't talk about why tables are or aren't good, that suggests an issue. They're not 
    absorbing information core to their job.
