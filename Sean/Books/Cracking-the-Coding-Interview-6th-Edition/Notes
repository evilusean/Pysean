Chapter 1: Introduction- Page 16-19====================================================================================================
Virtual Function(C)=A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class.
BST(Binary Search Tree)=Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition, and removal of data items. Since the nodes in a BST are
  laid out so that each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree, the lookup performance is proportional to that of binary logarithm. 
  BSTs were devised in the 1960s for the problem of efficient storage
WhiteBoards=Used for coding interviews for the interviewee to explain their thought process/problem solving skills- Ask questions

II-Behind the Scenes-Page 20-26=========================================================================================================
Personal Interview -> Screening Interview -> Technical Interview
Ask interviewer coordinator their position in the company, the technical interview(coding+algo questions) will be done by an engineer
Some companies will give you homework, or use a synchronized code writing, or on paper and say it over phone, 
Relative Comparisons=You are being compared with the other interviewees, if the problem is hard for you, it is hard for them- its ok to get wrong
After interview if you don't hear back in 3-5 business days, check in politely with your interviewer in a week, or HR-they might be busy
If you fail an interview most will let you apply again in 6-12 months
Normally 3-6 interviews before an offer
Often your interview goes to a hiring commitee with your interviewers feedback where they will decide 'offer' 'more interviews' or 'rejectsean'
Be nice to your interviewer, they can fight for you to be hired or not
Explain your passion for technology, prepare answer, "Why do you want to work for us?" -Mention VS Code for Microsoft, etc
You will only reach the hiring manager if you've done well
Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding,  Experience, and Communication) and you are given an 
  overall score from 1.0 to 4.0
If the hiring committee recommends an offer, your packet will go to a compensation committee and then to the executive management committee. 
  Returning a decision can take several weeks because there are so many stages and committees.
