Maybe add a nutritional section and notes section?
I really don't want to get that autistic about food again, measuring grams of chicken to get grams of protein was hella tedious -
calories(~2.4k)/protein(~200g)/carbs(<100g)  is nice to know though - at least ballpark
No Sneed Oils - Ever. Absolute Garbage. Why is everyone fat? Food is literal poison. 
HFCS  - Misc Chemical Garbage - Bribed FDA - trust the $cience. etc, etc, etc, etc 
Overprocessing remove every micronutrients - 
big corpos intentionally remove iodine from salt, causing you to crave it
'Cheese' is 'Cheese Product' - even the corrupt AF FDA can't write that one off
-margarine is what? like compositionally 2 atoms in the molecule away from plastic
-forever chemicals? who put them there? sure AF wasn't me, bro, I wouldn't wish western so called '"cuisine'" on my worst enemy - that's just cruel - it just causes you to become fat and dumb and dependant for 60-70 years, then you die - what a life - what is a moral hazard? oh and we give free money (EBT) cards, so that we can give big corpos(the guys profiting off reduicing food quality and posioning literally everyone) even more financial incentive to do so - Kraft: now we are giving tax dollars to give kids lead poisoning? technically you paid for that. Disgusting. 
Instead of 'get healthy, don't be fat' it's 'get taxpayers to pay for our multi thousand dollar drug a year for life' - just, wow, and 80% of you MF'ers are down for it. Step 1) Escape
when did it become cool to trust big pharma? and big corpo? they just threw up the rainbow flag and you all started blowing them - unbeleiveable -we are not the same - 
Not only are they fat, they're stupid, corrupt, selfish, arrogant, insane, and they want you to pay for it, lol, lmao, etc, etc
Glyphosate used as a desiccant - kills everything it touches, plants, bugs, mold, fungi, but somehow it is safe for human consumption? Lol, Lmao. FDA Approooved -
