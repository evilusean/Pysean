Maybe add a nutritional section and notes section?
I really don't want to get that autistic about food again, measuring grams of chicken to get grams of protein was hella tedious -
calories(~2.4k)/protein(~200g)/carbs(<100g)  is nice to know though - at least ballpark
No Sneed Oils - Ever. Absolute Garbage. Why is everyone fat? Food is literal poison. 
HFCS  - Misc Chemical Garbage - Bribed FDA - trust the $cience. etc, etc, etc, etc 
Overprocessing remove every micronutrients - 
big corpos intentionally remove iodine from salt, causing you to crave it
the entire GD system is entirely dependant on you being too stupid to figure it out(you are).
"Tolerance and Apathy are the last 2 virtues of a dying society" -Aristotle
'Cheese' is 'Cheese Product' - even the corrupt AF FDA can't write that one off
-margarine is what? like compositionally 2 atoms in the molecule away from plastic
-forever chemicals? who put them there? sure AF wasn't me, bro, I wouldn't wish western so called '"cuisine'" on my worst enemy - that's just cruel - it just causes you to become fat and dumb and dependant for 60-70 years, then you die - what a life - what is a moral hazard? oh and we give free money (EBT) cards, so that we can give big corpos(the guys profiting off reduicing food quality and posioning literally everyone) even more financial incentive to do so - Kraft: now we are giving tax dollars to give kids lead poisoning? technically you paid for that. Disgusting. 
Instead of 'get healthy, don't be fat' it's 'get taxpayers to pay for our multi thousand dollar drug a year for life' - just, wow, and 80% of you MF'ers are down for it. Step 1) Escape
They make you sick, and then sell you the cure, make everyone else pay for it  - and you thank them? ~ Do you know what I could do if housing markets weren't propped up, and I didn't have HALF my salary garnished in taxes for insane projects? 400 Million. That's 10 for every canadian. InflateSean steals your labor faster than wages go up, or you are able to earn it.  It's not theft when '"we"' do it though. You know who is backing up the CMHC mortgage bonds? Not my PenSean, I can do grade 5 math, I realized over a decade ago(early 20's, P < P + I) that I wasn't getting one and the system was bound to fail - Not so funny now, is it? Lol, Lmao. 
Do you know how many canadians are dependant on govt? Half. When your paycheck depends on you not seeing something, you won't sean it. You spent 40+ years listening to liars, now, somehow, I'm on the hook for their literally unpayable debts? Hypocrits. Odious.  We investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing, not only was no one fired, they voooooted themselves raises. Surely there is a limit to how much garbage (metaphorically and physically) people are willing to eat? Nope. Lol, Lmao. Step 1) Escape. canada is a failed state, don't be around when it does. 
when did it become cool to trust big pharma? and big corpo? and big govt? they just threw up the rainbow flag and you all started blowing them - unbeleiveable -we are not the same - 
Not only are they fat, they're stupid, corrupt, selfish, arrogant, insane, and they want you to pay for it, lol, lmao, etc, etc
			Glyphosate used as a desiccant - kills everything it touches, plants, bugs, mold, fungi, but somehow it is safe for human consumption? Lol, Lmao. FDA Approooved -
