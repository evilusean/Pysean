added 500ish recipes(3 days of work-tedious)

random button doesn't work, already put a few hours into it and every 'fix' 
	I attempt further breaks the code, the 'random' button works locally but when I run it on vercel it's hard stuck on 'Baked Tilapia' , when I try to fix it, the code won't load the recipes locally - at all, so I won't even bother to deploy that on vercel - so right now, I'm just stuck with a broken random button, I've already put almost a week into this and am falling behind in languages/anki work, I also need to do docker this month, going to just let that bug slide for now, future seans problem. - if It's a choice between random not working, and no recipes at all, let's go with the lesser evil here.
