MathJax (Mathematical XeLatex) for Obsidian(JS Based) - Wrap it in '$' like '$f(x)$' or '$$' for a code block/longer formulas - actually pretty cool - no longer need xelatex in markdown :

Use DropBox or ICloud / GoogleDrive to sync between devices - Obsidian Sync is a Payed feature :
https://www.dropbox.com/

https://workingcopy.app/
For Syncing PC and iOS(Iphone):

  Couldn’t you theoretically use SyncThing? Point to a folder on your Linux system then point to an iCloud folder on your Mac to make those two folders sync with SyncThing? 
  In theory it should work but I’ll need to test for sure. Edit: This completely works. Just install SyncThing to your Linux Machine and Mac then create a Vault in iCloud. 
  From there share that folder in SyncThing on Mac and share to your Linux machine. When it asks if you want to receive say yes then add the folder to your Linux machine and open from Obsidian on Linux. Violá.
  You have a link that works both ways. You’ll see any updates you make on Linux show up instantly on all your Apple devices that have the vault attached to it.
You can just create a vault in a github repo on PC and then upload it to github - it's just markdown - nothing fancy(fanSean) - and then push it to that repo for a backup - can save project ideas that way

Use Symlinks for backing up obsidian notes (like drop box folder or github) if you don't want to backup/publicize your entire obsidian notes - just select folders like project notes:

Other Opseans for schizoboarding(System Design Diagram) :
draw.io

Python Libraries:
Graphviz: Good for programmatically generating diagrams.
NetworkX with Matplotlib: Useful for network-like diagrams.
Figma FigJam :

Scheduling : Use Google Calendar (for reminders or iOS)
'Full Calendar' Plugin works for Google Calendar, but date time is bugged, ghetto fix is to just change it to a repeating event that ends that day - something about UTC timezone not working - forgot links explanASean
  You can still get notified on your phone, but it's read only, that just means you have to set the event on your phone and can view it in obsidian - which is fine - cheap fix, but works
