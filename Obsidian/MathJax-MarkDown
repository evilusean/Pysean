Since I'm going to be using MathJax instead of xelatex, I should probably write down how to do each formula here, for future Sean.

Draw a symbol and receive tex symbols that match (or screenshot+AI):https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
Can also be used in Anki, for making flashcards, for future Sean : https://docs.ankiweb.net/math.html#:~:text=customize%20some%20settings.-,LaTeX,display%20the%20generated%20image%20instead.

'$' #use for inline 
'$$' #use for multiline formula
Exponents = {base}^{exponent} 
Division Line = \frac{top}{bottom}
Radical Sign / Square Root = '\sqrt{x^3}' or '\sqrt[3]{\frac xy}' #this one will show a '3' above the 'check Radical'
Escape Character = '\' used for '\[' or '\(' where you want to display the parenthesis without breaking the code
Delta = \Delta
Lim (as limit approaches 0) = '\lim' or '\lim_{x\to 0}'
