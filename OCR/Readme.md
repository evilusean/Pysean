OCR - Short for 'Optical Character Recognition' - I want to do some work on this for future Sean - 
scanning PDF's/Images for words, and turning them into a more readable/searchable format - I have 80,000 documents to go through looking for very '"specific"' terms,
and I already don't have enough time in the day to do coding, languages, ~400ish flashcards, and now sleuth through images/pdfs of over 80,000 documents looking for '"clues"'.

This is just a repo to store all my projects/toools/links/resources
