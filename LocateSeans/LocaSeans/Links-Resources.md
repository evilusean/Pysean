I preferably would be far away from cantada and cantadians, because I don't want to spend the next however many decades of my life dealing with these treachorous idiots and cleaning up their mess, living in the fiery but mostly peaceful aftermath of their failed fabian experiement, or, at best, managed decline till they devalue the currency until we need a mediocre reset that takes decades to undo the damages of profligate ignorant *expletives*.  Or, the bad reset(great for '"some people"', it's relative), where the new managerial class, the techno pharisees attempt create a panopticon control grid largely to manage the problems '"they"' created in the first place, the visigoths(actually, on second thought, goths would be an upgrade at this point, cleaner and more civilized) aren't at the gates, you let them in. Oopsies, poopsie, the millions of hostile people we brought in, and forced you to pay for, are violent and stealing everything, guess we need total control over literally everything before it all collapses anyways. Whoopsie, sucks to suck. Are they corrupt or incompetent?  Yes. The sh!t covered blade is already lodged firmly in their ribcage, I am simply waiting to see if they die from sepsis, exsanguination, or asphyxiation. Après moi le déluge. I'm trying to get to higher ground before they do. 

They've already stolen enough (literal decades have been stolen from me, of my best years, lost opportunity cost, and I'm gaslit about it, I still haven't received a single apology).
We are in the looting the treasury and hiring foreign mercenaries stage of collapse. It's pretty hard to focus on the '"people"' looting trillions from the treasury and currency devaluation, when there is a man physically pooping on the street and robbing grandma in front of you, one kind of takes immediate visceral precedence over the other. Never forget, '"who"' let them in? You think the people with 67 IQ are smart enough to realize they are being made the scapegoat for decades(centuries?) of bad policy by illegitimate so called leaders? Lol, Lmao. You still think vooooooting matters? You are choosing between 2 different colors of the same sh!t. They want to distract you, so they can continue looting unabated, and when the collapse does happen, they can point to them and say '"see, it wasnt us, we should create the exact same system that just collapsed with us in charge again"' and restart their scam again in a few decades. Until you realize that you are under hostile foreign occupation, nothing will make sense. They aren't y'"our"' governments, they are a looting mechanism. The just-us system is an enforcement tool. The majority are willingly ignorant at this point. Propagandized cradle to grave. Who is more culpable? The sh!t eaters or the sh!t spewers? Like a dog returning to it's vomit. You really gonna eat that? Oh, they did, again.. I used to ask 'How did it get this bad?', after covid, I get it. Gnostics were right about hylics. Let the dead bury the dead. The white and black pill, is that it's collapsing, it's inevitable. The real game, is surviving to see what comes next.

-   -Slope Break(where elevation changes from steep to small)
- **The Sun-Facing Side:** In the Northern Hemisphere, you should build on a **gentle south-facing slope**
-  [[03:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=184)].
-  **Home Orientation:** The house should be elongated along an East-West axis [[03:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=202)].
-  This allows the low winter sun to strike the long side of the house for maximum warmth and light.
-  You can shift this orientation by up to 20 degrees East or West and still get the full effect [[03:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=218)].
- **Rivers:** Build on the **outside of a river bend**, which is the high side. Avoid the inside of the bend, as that is the floodplain [[06:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=377)].
- **Confluences:** A terrace above the meeting point of two streams is a "gold mine" location because of the fertile soil and easy irrigation options [[06:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=412)].
- **Clustering:** For sustainability and lower infrastructure costs, it is better to cluster homes together rather than spreading them out [[09:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=574)].

Cool Stuff to build When you escape the normie cattle vax/tax maxxers - They poisoned themselves and their kids because the TV told them to, do you really want to be around them in an actual crisis? Imagine there is no food, power, in our low trust soyciety someone decided to loot the power cables for the few thousand dollars of copper in them. When the very real copper is worth more than the hollow threats and empty promises of a dying empire, during a storm in $-40\degree$ weather, no one is being paid for enforcement/good behavior, and you are surrounded by these idiots and the ~70IQ millions they brought in to bolster their ranks.

- #CodeIdea #ProjectSean #Cabin ExploraSean LocaSean ExtractSean ExcavaSean - Look for gold claims in canada, next to rivers, map them, explore the areas that have former gold mines/claims/etc . While looking for a place to build a cabin.  Optimal Prospecting Timeline - Summer(Peak Dryness), Early Fall(Low Water), Post Flood(Reset 'PayDay' after major rain event, gold gets washed down from mountains, and magnetite/gold gets exposed as light sand is washed away) - inside bend of rivers, look for bedrock, and scrape the dirt from that with a crevice tool/screwdriver and pan it, dig on the downstream of large bolders, black sand(magnetite)/moss for 'flour gold' - Gold is dense, that's why you can 'pan' it.

- After checking the maps, theres a tonne of old mines in St.Johns(Seans?) NB that borders on Maine and the Coast -St George, Grand Manan . Regulation and "'The irving Factor'" This is the practical reason you see fewer "old mines" on maps:- **Land Ownership:** A massive percentage of New Brunswick is "'crown Land'" or owned by large forestry companies (like '"j.d. irving"'). In Maine, land is more fractured with smaller private lots, which historically led to more "mom and pop" mines that now show up as dots on your map.- **Stricter Licensing:** To pan legally in NB, you technically need a **Prospecting License** ($100 for life) if you want to do anything beyond very casual "recreational" dipping of a pan. Maine has a much more established "recreational mining" culture with clearer rules for hobbyists. Where can you actually go in NB?If you are near Saint John, you are actually in one of the better spots. There is a "Gold Belt" that runs from **Stephen/St. George** through to **Saint John**.- **Clarence Stream Area:** This is the "big one" currently being explored. It’s west of Saint John. While you can't pan on active claims, the streams in this general region (Charlotte County) are your best bet.- **The Lepreau River:** There have been historical reports of "flour gold" here.- **The Ovens (Nova Scotia):** If you are willing to drive, _The Ovens Natural Park_ in NS is the most famous "public" panning spot in the Maritimes where gold is actually guaranteed to be in the sand (though it's very fine).**A tip for your search:** Instead of looking for "Gold Mines," look for **"Antimony"** or **"Copper"** mines in the NB DNR database. In New Brunswick, gold is almost always a "hitchhiker" with those metals. - ### 1. The "Gold Belt" South of Saint John The most consistent gold finds in New Brunswick are along the **Fundy Shear Zone**, which runs just west of Saint John.- **Cape Spencer (15km SE of Saint John):** This is home to an actual past-producing mine. While you cannot pan on active claims, the surrounding coastline and small streams that cut through the local quartz-rich rocks are known to have microscopic "flour gold."- **Lepreau River & Little Lepreau:** Recent exploration (as of 2021-2024) has confirmed gold in the tills and soils here. Look for access points where the river cuts through gravel bars.- **Musquash & Dipper Harbour:** Historical records mention gold in the "heavy mineral concentrates" of the sands in these coastal areas.## 2. The Charlotte County "Hot Zone" If you look west of Saint John toward St. Stephen, you hit the **Clarence Stream** area. This is currently the most significant gold discovery in the province.  **Magaguadavic River:** Gold has been found in the "drift" (glacial material) around this river system. - **Rollingdam & Moores Mills:** Both of these areas have historic records for "alluvial gold" (gold found in river gravel). They are closer to the Maine border and share more of that "Maine-style" geology.### 3. The "Saint John River Gold" There is a specific occurrence in the provincial database titled **"Saint John River Gold" (Occurrence 228)**.  While much of the river is too deep or silted for panning, historical reports mention gold being found in the gravels near **Upper Northampton** (south of Woodstock). - LIDAR(Light Detection and Ranging) to see whats already been dug Vs GPR(Ground Penetrating Radar) to see where the fault/fissures/shear zones are(squeezed quartz) or paleochannels(dried riverbeds) Vs Magnetometer(gold is next to magnetite/iron) - Core Drills ### Visible Gold (VG) is being found In the last few years (2021–2024), exploration companies in Northern and Southern NB have reported **Visible Gold** in drill cores and surface samples.- **Williams Brook (Northern NB):** Companies like Puma Exploration have found high-grade quartz veins with visible specks and small "clots" of gold.- **Clarence Stream (Southwest NB):** This site has "free gold," meaning the gold isn't just trapped inside other minerals; it exists as distinct grains. In Maine or BC, you might find a "picker" (a small nugget you can pick up with your fingers).- **St Croix River** (US-Can 110 km river that borders maine on one side and NB on the other) **Monument Brook** (US-Can St croix tributary) **Scott Brook**(US-Can St Croix Tributary)- **St John River**(US-Can - Wolastoq + Tributaries) - **Aroostook**(US-Can - Perth-Andover + Tributaries + Placer gold) - **Presque Isle** (US-Can - Aroostook tributary) - **River de Chute** (US-Can - Aroostook tributary) **Meduxnekeag River**(US-Can near woodstock + Black sand) **Baker Brook**(US-Can + Glacial Placer) - **Sheba Pit** and **Devil Pike Brook**(Annidale Belt, around Sussex/Hampton, veins) In New Brunswick, we have a **"Glacial Dilution"** problem: - **The "Smearing" Effect:** During the last Ice Age, glaciers ground down the gold-bearing quartz veins. In Maine, the glaciers often dropped that material into river valleys. In NB, the glaciers "smeared" the gold across the landscape in a thick layer of clay and till.- **Encapsulation:** Much of NB's gold is "refractory," meaning it is tiny grains trapped inside **Pyrite** (Fool's Gold) or **Arsenopyrite**. You might have a "nugget" of pyrite in your pan that actually contains gold, but you can't see it without crushing the rock and using chemicals. There is one famous spot in NB where "coarse" gold was actually mined: **Murray Brook** (North of Bathurst) 

-  For Flour Gold : Use a blue batea pan/snuffer/Jewelers 10x Triplet Loupe(magnifier)/sieves(filters)/jet dry surfactant/Sluice + Dream Mat(combo vs micro)/carry 100w solar blanket for battery, pump, sluice, cellphone, and starlink/magnet(magnetite removal)/smelt(borax flux) into dore = profit - ### What is a Dream Mat? It is a heavy-duty urethane mat covered in a patented pattern of **vortex cells**.- **The Vortex Principle:** Instead of water crashing over a metal bar (a riffle), it flows into thousands of tiny circular cells. Each cell creates a "mini hydro-cyclone" (a vortex).- **The "Exchange" Action:** As water spins in the cell, the heavy gold is sucked into the center and held at the bottom. Lighter sand and rocks are "kicked out" of the vortex and continue down the sluice. - **The Benefit:** It is "active." Unlike carpet, which gets clogged with black sand (blinding it), a Dream Mat constantly clears itself out, leaving only the heaviest minerals (gold) in the cells. 

- First, find 'paydirt'(black sand) sift/filter it, run it through the sluice with dream mat, if you find a good spot, build a cabin there, eventually do core drills to try to 'find' where the gold came from, a quartz vein, make sure you actually own the land and it's not a claim on '"crown land"' before doing any of that, _NB e-CLAIMS_. If you don't own the mineral rights, someone else can "claim-jump" you online in seconds. - **Advanced Exploration**. Under a standard mineral claim, you are allowed to take "bulk samples" (up to a certain tonnage) to test your equipment. Many people "test" their quartz for years, effectively running a tiny, one-man operation while staying under the radar of major mining regulations. ### 1. The Best Time of Year: June to September The official legal window for most prospecting activities in New Brunswick is **June 1st to September 30th**. - **The "Gold" Window (Late July – August):** This is the sweet spot. The water levels in rivers like the Magaguadavic or the Miramichi drop, exposing the **"Low Water Gravels"** and bedrock benches that are underwater the rest of the year. This is where the heaviest gold settles.- **The Spring Danger (April – May):** Avoid the rivers during the "Spring Freshet." The water is dangerously fast, freezing cold, and usually too muddy to see anything. More importantly, high water moves the gold _around_, but it's nearly impossible to catch it until the flow slows down. - **The Autumn Rush (September):** This is a great time to work before the ground freezes, but keep in mind that New Brunswick's fall rains can raise river levels overnight, potentially washing away a sluice box left unattended.* ### New Brunswick Gold Sampling Strategy  * Systematically test potential rivers by sieving material through a 1/8" classifier on-site to remove "waste rock," then transport the labeled concentrate bags(with coordinates) back to the cabin for high-precision recovery and comparison. - **The "Pay" Logic:** If you sieve your dirt through a **1/8" or 1/4" screen** at the river, you are left with a "concentrate." This concentrate contains 100% of the gold from that hole but only 10% of the weight.- **The Result:** You can fit the "pay" from five different holes into a single backpack.  To find the best spot to move your sluice, use the **"Speck Count"** method. Label your bags (e.g., "River A - Bedrock Crack" - coordinate xyz) and when you get to the cabin, run them through your Dream Mat one by one. * Move on from "Traces" (0–5 specks), consider a full day of panning for "Colors" (10–30 specks), but stop and move your sluice immediately if you hit a "Paystreak" of 50+ specks per 2-gallon bag. ### 3. The "Sampling Bag" Strategy Don't use buckets for testing; use **Heavy Duty 2-Gallon Ziplocs** or **Sandbags**.1. **At the River:** Dig a "sample hole" (usually down to the clay layer or bedrock).2. **Sieve:** Shake the dirt through a 1/8" classifier into a tub of water.3. **Bag:** Scoop the fines into a bag. Stick a piece of waterproof paper inside with the GPS coordinates or a description (e.g., "North Bank, behind big boulder").4. **Repeat:** Do this at 5 different spots along the river. - if canada joins the us, escape to Tennessee, Northern California, Oregon, Washington, BC, North Idaho, West Montana, South Dakota Black Hills, Arizona, Appalachia(carolina slate belt), Georgia - Why work for loonies, it doesn't make cents(remember when we used to have pennies? made from copper then worth-less zinc, until they deprecated the currency so badly, even that was too expensive to mint. Lol, Lmao), when '"goverments and bankers"' are hyperinflating the current-sean, current Sean, returns to the currents Sean(scene). 

- 1. The Best Way to View Waterways - For New Brunswick, you should skip Google Maps and use **[GeoNB](https://geonb.snb.ca/geonb/)**. It is the province's official mapping tool and is far superior for finding water. - **The "Hydrographic" Layer:** In the GeoNB map viewer, turn on the **New Brunswick Hydrographic Network (NBHN)**. This shows every tiny stream, seasonal runoff, and "inferred" center-line that Google Maps ignores.- **Topography:** You can toggle on high-resolution contour lines. In prospecting, you want "breaks in grade" (where a steep stream hits a flat area), as this is where gold drops out of the water.- **Satellite Clarity:** GeoNB’s orthophotos (aerial photos) are often higher resolution for New Brunswick than Google’s, allowing you to see gravel bars and bedrock "benches" clearly.### 2. How to Find Rivers for Sluicing (The "Legality" Map)In New Brunswick, you cannot just drop a sluice anywhere. You need to use the **[NB e-CLAIMS Map](https://nbeclaims.gnb.ca/nbeclaims/)**.- **Step 1: Check for Active Claims.** Click "View Maps" as a guest. Any area shaded in **blue or red** is someone else's private mineral claim. You are **not allowed** to prospect or sluice there without their written permission.- **Step 2: Look for "Open" Ground.** Any river or brook that is _not_ covered by a colored block is open for prospecting.- **Step 3: The Licensing.** To use a sluice (even a hand-fed one), you must have a **Prospecting Licence** ($100 one-time fee).    - **Hand-Panning only:** No extra permit needed.   - **Sluicing:** Requires a **WAWA (Watercourse and Wetland Alteration) Permit** if you are in the water.### 3. Prospecting "Hot Spots" in NB - Based on geological data and local history, here are the areas to look for on your maps:- **The Sussex Area:** Historically known for small amounts of gold in the streams around the old potash mines.- **Albert Mines/Fundy Coast:** The Point Wolfe River and surrounding brooks have high quartz content. Look for "Recent Landslides" on satellite view; these expose new material for the water to wash.- **Central Highlands:** Areas around the **Miramichi** and **Bathurst** have massive sulfide deposits that often contain trace gold. Look for "Fault Lines" on the [Metallogenic Map of NB](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/en/pdf/Minerals-Minerales/NR7_2002-e.pdf); gold usually follows these cracks in the earth.### Summary Checklist for your Map Search: 1. **GeoNB:** Find the water and the "benches" (flat gravel areas next to the river).2. **NB e-CLAIMS:** Ensure the area is "Open" and not someone's private claim.3. **Google Maps (Satellite View):** Check for logging roads or trails to see if you can actually get your truck/backpack to the spot. 

- While you are sluicing for flour gold, your pan and sluice will naturally catch other heavy minerals. New Brunswick is geologically diverse, and the same "volcanic" and "metamorphic" forces that brought gold to the surface also created several semi-precious stones. ### 1. The "Big Three" River Stones in NB - Besides gold, these are the most common valuable or semi-precious finds: #### **A. Garnets**These are the most common "heavy" stones you’ll find in your black sand concentrates.- **What they look like:** Small, translucent "balls" or 12-sided crystals. In NB, they are usually **Almandine** (deep wine-red to purple).- **Identification:** Look for a "glassy" luster. If you hold a clean one to the light, it should glow deep red. Unlike red Jasper (which is opaque), Garnets are often see-through.- **Where to find them:** Everywhere gold is found. They have a high specific gravity, so they settle in your riffles right alongside the gold.#### **B. Agate & Jasper**New Brunswick (specifically the Bay of Fundy and northern rivers) is world-famous for these.- **What they look like:** * **Agate:** Translucent, often with "banding" or stripes.    - **Jasper:** Opaque (you can't see through it), usually brick-red, yellow, or green. **Identification:** Both have a **Conchoidal fracture**—meaning when they break, they leave sharp, curved edges like broken glass.- **The "Lick" Test:** Rocks always look better wet. An agate will look like a dull potato when dry, but when wet, it will reveal glowing, waxy layers.### **C. Zeolites (Stilbite / Heulandite)** These are found in the volcanic "pockets" of southern NB. **What they look like:** Peach-colored or white "sheaves" that look like bundles of wheat or tiny crystals.- **Identification:** They are much softer than quartz. If you can scratch it with a copper penny, it might be a zeolite.### 2. The "Jackpot" Stones (Rare)- **Amethyst:** Purple quartz. It is occasionally found in the gravels of the **Bay of Fundy** or near the **Bathurst** area. Look for a hexagonal (6-sided) crystal shape with a purple tip.- **Native Copper:** In the **Bay of Fundy** and near **Grand Falls**, you can find actual "nuggets" of pure copper. They look like green, crusty "rocks," but if you scratch them with a file, they reveal a bright, metallic orange-pink interior.### 3. Quick ID Table for your Pan### 4. How to Identify them in the River1. **The Hardness Test:** Most valuable stones (Quartz, Agates, Garnets) are harder than steel. If a rock can scratch a glass bottle, it is likely a semi-precious silicate2. **The Light Test:** Carry a small LED flashlight. Place the stone on the light. If the light glows through the stone (Translucency), it is worth keeping for further inspection.3. **The "Black Sand" Association:** If you find a spot with a massive amount of "heavy" black sand (Magnetite), look closely for tiny red grains. Those are **Industrial Garnets**, a sign that the "gravity trap" in that river is working perfectly. ### 1. The "Loupe" Test (The True Gold Standard) The most important tool for any prospector is a **10x Triplet Loupe**.- **Why:** You aren't just looking for light; you are looking for **inclusions** (the "birthmarks" inside the stone).- **The ID:** Natural garnets often have tiny "needle" inclusions, while glass (which can pass the light test) will often have tiny round air bubbles. If you see bubbles, it's almost certainly trash.### 2. The Ultraviolet (UV) Test This is the "High-Tech" version of the light test. Many gems (like Rubies and some New Brunswick Agates) will **fluoresce** (glow) under a UV light.- **Pro Tip:** If you have a red stone and it glows neon red under UV light, it’s likely a Ruby. If it stays dark or dull, it’s likely a Garnet.### 3. Hardness Test (Mohs Scale)Light can be fooled, but physics can't.- **The Test:** Try to scratch a piece of common glass with your stone.    - If it **cannot** scratch glass, it is likely a soft mineral like Calcite or Fluorite.    - If it **easily** scratches glass, you are in the "Gem" family (Quartz, Garnet, Topaz).

- * ### DIY Concrete Mineral Requirements * **Primary Mineral:** Limestone (Calcium Carbonate - will fizz when combined with lemon juice or vinegar). Requires "Calcining" at 1450°C to create Lime. * **Secondary Minerals:** Shale or Clay (Silica/Alumina) and Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate) to control set time. * **Identification:** Limestone will "fizz" in contact with acid; Gypsum is soft enough to scratch with a fingernail. * **NB Context:** Most viable for cabins in the Sussex/Havelock/Restigouche belt where Limestone and Gypsum deposits overlap. - ### 1. The Core Mineral: Limestone (Calcium) Limestone is the most critical ingredient (about 60–70% of the mix).- **What it does:** When heated, limestone (1$CaCO_3$) releases 2$CO_2$ and becomes **Quicklime** (3$CaO$), which is the primary reactive agent in cement.4- **Where to find it in NB:** You are looking for the **Havelock** or **Sussex** areas, or parts of the **Restigouche** region. Look for "karst" topography (caves or sinkholes) and grey, blocky rocks that fizz when you drop lemon juice or vinegar on them.### 2. The Secondary Mineral: Shale or Clay (Silicon & Aluminum)You need a source of silica and alumina (about 20–30% of the mix).- **What it does:** These minerals react with the lime to create the "silicate" bond that gives concrete its strength.- **Where to find it:** This is easy in NB. Most of the "blue clay" found at the bottom of our riverbeds or the crumbly dark **Shale** found in road cuts works perfectly.### 3. The "Setting" Mineral: Gypsum- **What it does:** You only need a tiny amount (about 5%). Without it, your concrete would flash-set (harden instantly) before you could pour it.5- **Where to find it:** NB is famous for its **Gypsum** (look near Hillsborough or Sussex). It’s a very soft, white/clear mineral that you can scratch with your fingernail.6 ### 4. The "Backwoods" Recipe for Cement If you actually want to make it at the cabin, the process is called **Calcining**:1. **Crush:** Grind your limestone and shale/clay into a fine powder.72. **The Kiln:** You must heat this mixture to roughly **1450°C (2640°F)**. This is much hotter than a standard campfire; you would need a bellows-fed forge or a specialized kiln.  3. **Clinker:** The powder will turn into small, grey marbles called "clinker."    4. **Final Grind:** Grind the clinker into the fine grey dust we know as cement, and stir in your 5% crushed gypsum.
