I preferably would be far away from canada and canadians, because I don't want to spend the next however many decades of my life dealing with these treachorous idiots and cleaning up their mess. 
They've already stolen enough (literal decades have been stolen from me, of my best years, lost opportunity cost, and I'm gaslit about it, I still haven't received a single apology.).

#CodeIdea #Cabin 
Create an app/program/script that can tell me of all the locations that have a river that is on a cliff face that goes down where I can recreate some of the features of the alhambre, 
with a small slope going a large distance, creating a ram pump and doing very cool water works, unironically, it is about location, 
I want to be at the top of a mountain with a steady stream of water for power and waterworks(I used to want to live on the coast, how times have changed), 
create an app that can track elevation of rivers and streams and find a nice spot to buy land, I would love to live in appalachia, 
or canada has alot of spots I can build cool shit in, step 1 is escaping the rent seeking parasites of '"them"' and fellow cantadians, 
where, somehow, in a country with infinite landmass and resources EVERYTHING is prohibitively expensive and requires a piece of paper just to dig a hole.
(++taxes, ++inflation, ++debt, ++laws, ++immigration, ++fraud, ++credentialism, ++financialization, ++offshoring(arbitrage), ++onshoring(indians) ++'"private equity"' backed by '"central banks"', just compete with infinite people from india and a money printer(it's your fault if you can't compete against slavery). Social CON~~tr~~ACT - '"they"'/jboomers REALLY fucked over young people - less free now than medieval peasents, at least they had to feed and house their slaves - you really want me to bust my ass for 40k a year when '"they"' are printing trillions? With how many quadrillions in derivatives? Lol, Lmao. completely destroy every incentive and system, and then blaME the victIM's, actually insane, psychopathic narcissists. ) -
Repeat after me : 'Housing. Is. Not. A. Speculative. Investment.' - There, I fixed your housing ponzi. You're welcome.

-   -Slope Break(where elevation changes from steep to small)
- **The Sun-Facing Side:** In the Northern Hemisphere, you should build on a **gentle south-facing slope**
-  [[03:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=184)].
-  **Home Orientation:** The house should be elongated along an East-West axis [[03:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=202)].
-  This allows the low winter sun to strike the long side of the house for maximum warmth and light.
-  You can shift this orientation by up to 20 degrees East or West and still get the full effect [[03:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=218)].
- **Rivers:** Build on the **outside of a river bend**, which is the high side. Avoid the inside of the bend, as that is the floodplain [[06:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=377)].
- **Confluences:** A terrace above the meeting point of two streams is a "gold mine" location because of the fertile soil and easy irrigation options [[06:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=412)].
- **Clustering:** For sustainability and lower infrastructure costs, it is better to cluster homes together rather than spreading them out [[09:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trz6NvsUQQ&t=574)].
