I got the idea to create a script/app to find the perfect spot to build a house away from the normies, literally a hermit in the mountains, 
if you live on a coastal city you are at the mercy of water warfare, and anyone can cut off your water supply who has a higher elevation than you,
I want to be able to put in a series of values/requirements (elevation, water supply, etc.) and have the app/program tell me the best locations to build/buy land in.
Since most normies are obsessed with coastal cities and the hustle+bustle of dieversity, land, should, theoretically, be cheap.
