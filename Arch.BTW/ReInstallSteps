All the steps taken to get Arch Linux back up to a funcSeanall state, all packages installed, how to get nvidia GPU working again, how to install all packages
Links\Resources\Commands for each step - Hopefully this will be the last time I have to do this, can't mount boot this time, need to repartition drives

Step 1 : Bootable USB + Wifi - 
Restart -> Press (F2) + (F12) -> F8 -> Boot from USB -> Arch Linux

iwctl
device wlan0 set-property Powered off
device wlan0 set-property Powered on
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect

Step 2 : Partition the disks 
fdisk -l #lists all partitions in detail
cfdisk #tool to partition disks with GUI
  /boot partition = b W95 FAT32 = 2Gigs
  / partiton(root) = 83 Linux = 45Gigs
  /home partition = 83 Linux = Whatever is left off SSD

Step 2.5 : Make Filesystems :
  mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3

Step 3: Mount Partitions :
  mount /dev/sda1 /boot
  mount /dev/sda2 /
  mount /dev/sda3 /home
  swapon /dev/sdb1 
    Unmount(accidents happen) : umount /dev/sda2

Step 4: Archinstall
