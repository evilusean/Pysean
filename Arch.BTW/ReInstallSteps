All the steps taken to get Arch Linux back up to a funcSeanall state, all packages installed, how to get nvidia GPU working again, how to install all packages
Links\Resources\Commands for each step - Hopefully this will be the last time I have to do this, can't mount boot this time, need to repartition drives

Step 1 : Bootable USB + Wifi - 
Restart -> Press (F2) + (F12) -> F8 -> Boot from USB -> Arch Linux

iwctl
device wlan0 set-property Powered off
device wlan0 set-property Powered on
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect

Step 2 : Partition the disks 
fdisk -l #lists all partitions in detail
cfdisk #tool to partition disks with GUI
  /boot partition = b W95 FAT32 = 2Gigs
  / partiton(root) = 83 Linux = 45Gigs
  /home partition = 83 Linux = Whatever is left off SSD

Step 2.5 : Make Filesystems :
  mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3

Step 3: Mount Partitions :
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt # 'mount /dev/sda2 /' for root, I messed this up even after doing it 4 times in > 2 weeks, it's 'mount /dev/sda2 /mnt'
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot # 'mount /dev/sda1 /boot' for boot 
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home # 'mount /dev/sda3 /home' for home
swapon /dev/sdb1 

Step 3.5 : archinstall
  Go through the installer to ignore above section, easier this way, you can set mount points afrer step 2, 2.5 (you still need manual partititon and filesystems)
Assign mountpoints : 
  '/boot' -> sda1 (2Gigs)
  '/' -> sda2 -> 45Gigs
  '/home' -> sda3 -> whatever is left
