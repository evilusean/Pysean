A few differences from Arch-Hyprland and Omarchy - 'Super' + 'Enter' = Terminal, 'Tab' + 'Space' to log in to wifi

Mac Install :
2025-October-22 : Just reinstalled it on my 2012 macbook air with an intel i5 core, couldn't update OSX past High Sierra 10.13, hopefully this gives a second life to the machine
For mac (Will require a USB keyboard, my laptop is broken) 
sudo pacman -S broadcom-wl # install this for apple wifi drivers, this might of actually broke it, had to reinstall afterwards, had trouble with network
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils # for the keyboard, still having trouble with bluetooth keyboard not working on startup/login screen
sudo pacman -Syu # update all packages
Fix Keyboard : 
sudo nvim /etc/bluetooth/main.conf # 'AutoEnable=true' uncomment this line
sudo bluetoothctl # open this type 'pair' 'trust' 'connect <MAC_ID_of_keyboard>'
