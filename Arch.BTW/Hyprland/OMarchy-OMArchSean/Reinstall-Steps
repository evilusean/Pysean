A few differences from Arch-Hyprland and Omarchy - 'Super' + 'Enter' = Terminal, 'Tab' + 'Space' to log in to wifi

Mac Install :
2025-October-22 : Just reinstalled it on my 2012 macbook air with an intel i5 core, couldn't update OSX past High Sierra 10.13, hopefully this gives a second life to the machine
For mac (Will require a USB keyboard, my laptop is broken, the trick is to stop being poor and buy a wireless USB keyboard/mouse combo) 
sudo pacman -S syncthing # a private way for automatic updating of obsidian notes between machines
sudo nvim ~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf # change this to fix the lock screen, 5 min lock screen default

Get WaCom-Intuos Working on Arch Linux :
https://github.com/evilusean/Pysean/blob/main/Arch.BTW/Hyprland/WacomIntuos-Tablet-Stylus-Fix.md
'sudo pacman -S --needed xf86-input-wacom libwacom' # install these
'yay -S input-remapper-git' # to remap keys, so you aren't going back and forth on keyboard and can just draw from tablet
'input-remapper-gtk' # open the GUI 
name the preset 'Xournal', set autoload, Create each button, press 'Record' and record the input of each button, 
Far Left Button (Undo) : 'Button 0 + ABS MISC -' = 'KEY_LEFTCTRL + KEY_Z' 
Left Button (Lasso Tool) : 'Button 1 + ABS MISC -' = 'KEY_LEFTSHIFT + KEY_LEFTCTRL + KEY_G'
Right Button (Pen Tool) : 'Button 2 + ABS MISC -' = 'KEY_LEFTSHIFT + KEY_LEFTCTRL + KEY_P'
Far Right Button (New Page)	'Button 2 + ABS MISC -' =	'KEY_LEFTCTRL + KEY_D'
'systemctl status input-remapper' # need to keep the remappings inbetween restarts, I don't always want to spin up the remapper
'sudo systemctl enable input-remapper' # enable the process
'sudo systemctl start input-remapper' 
'Xournal ++' -> 'Edit' -> 'Preferences' -> 'Stylus' - Button 1 = Eraser, Button 2 = Grab - I just gained 2 buttons for my pad
