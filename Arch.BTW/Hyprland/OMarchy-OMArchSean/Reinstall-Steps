A few differences from Arch-Hyprland and Omarchy - 'Super' + 'Enter' = Terminal, 'Tab' + 'Space' to log in to wifi

Mac Install :
2025-October-22 : Just reinstalled it on my 2012 macbook air with an intel i5 core, couldn't update OSX past High Sierra 10.13, hopefully this gives a second life to the machine
For mac (Will require a USB keyboard, my laptop is broken) 
pacman -S broadcom-wl # install this for apple wifi drivers
pacman -S bluez bluez-utils # for the keyboard
