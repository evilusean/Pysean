Mac Install :
2025-October-22 : Just reinstalled it on my 2012 macbook air with an intel i5 core, couldn't update OSX past High Sierra 10.13, hopefully this gives a second life to the machine
For mac (Will require a USB keyboard, my laptop is broken, the trick is to stop being poor and buy a wireless USB keyboard/mouse combo) 
sudo pacman -S syncthing # a private way for automatic updating of obsidian notes between machines
sudo nvim ~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf # change this to fix the lock screen, 5 min lock screen default
