'./config/ags/modules/onscreenkeyboard' 
A Japanese keyboard layout in your on-screen keyboard (accessible by clicking the layout button)
System-wide Japanese input support through IBus
The ability to switch between US and Japanese layouts using Alt+Shift
To use the Japanese input:
Press Alt+Shift to switch to Japanese input
Type in romaji (e.g., "konnichiwa")
Press Space to convert to hiragana
Press Space again to cycle through conversion options (hiragana → katakana → kanji)
Press Enter to confirm the conversion
You can also use the on-screen keyboard's Japanese layout by:
Opening the on-screen keyboard
Clicking the layout button (which shows "US" or "DE")
Selecting "JP" to switch to the Japanese layout
Using Shift to toggle between hiragana and katakana characters
- Ok, I originally tried to rewrite the keyboard from english to Japanese after finding the JS files, 
  I wasted like 3 hours doing that, trying to write my own custom Japanese keyboard - but I found an easier way

Use :
fcitx5 #can change keyboard layout, swap between japanese and english with a hotkey
wvkbd #launches an onscreen wayland keybord that works with hyprland and arch
