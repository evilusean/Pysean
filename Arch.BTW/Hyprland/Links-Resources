DotFile/Install Script for my first attempt at using Hyprland :
https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland
- To fix the lock screen for this config - go to the '.config/hypr/hypridle.conf' and change the MS there
- To remove the weeb sidebar stuff '.config/ags/config.js' or '.config/ags/services' 
- Future Sean can also add his own tools to the siderbar in '/.config/ags/modules/...' for side left and side right
