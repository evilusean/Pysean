found old USB used to install ubuntu, formatted it, downloaded arch iso from a torrent, verfied, and added to the reformatted usb to make a bootable usb for install

ran 'mkinitcpio -P' from chroot, missing a tonne of firmware, will need to fix, 
/etc/mkinitcpio.conf
'initramfs' #this is what broke on ubuntu, couldn't fix and was running without a GPU for ? who knows how long - maybe this is why blender was terrible?
found in '/boot' from chroot 'initramfs-linux.img' and backup
'arch.conf' also mentions microloader for intel and initramfs, it is the bootloader config file found in '/boot/loader/entries'
just finished final step of installation guide, installed the bootloader, and removed the bootable USB, and was greeted with 'Invalid Partition Table', It's 3:03 

Ok, day 2, step 1 is to fix the wifi 
rfkill #checks wifi/bluetooth
rfkill unblock wlan #unblocks wifi
iwctl #puts it in wifi mode
modprobe -r rtl8723be
modprobe rtl8723be fwlps=0
device wlan0 set-property Powered off #have you tried turning it off and on again? this seemed to work last time
device wlan0 set-property Powered on
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect <network>
  enter <network> name, and then password, have it ready because I only have a few second window before it loses the network again (??)

ran 'archinstall' after getting network set up, it allowed me to automatically suggest the partition layout
I tried to manually do it before, using a UEFI setup, and something broke, it fixed the SSD drives and added a boot partition, installing arch linux to sda now
Succesfully logged in, created a new user, and now playing around.. the only thing I see is a terminal, no GUI

after getting back into chroot from bootable usb, install these before leaving, internet doesn't work without, get everything installed from initial chroot
pacman -S <package name>

Adding second hard drive:

pacman -S gnome-disk-utility

Ok, finally got it - don't use /home as a seperate directory, use archinstall - Archon? ArchSean - Power Overwhelming.
Tried to reboot, wouldn't load, maybe you do need /home as a seperate directory, found out why my 20gig boot partition might be filling up too quick -

https://pacman.archlinux.page/pacman.conf.5.html
pacman -Scc

Tried to install some things overnight, everything still works, except - 
'/run/media/ArchSean/bc1e0382-20ad-43a4-ad0d-f1adc06926ad' the hard drives are weirdly named, and some things won't install
going to try to rename these drives / mountpoints the mountpoint is used for the install, and it's length is causing problems with getting my system functional again

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Persistent_block_device_naming
I think if I reformat the drive(s), and add new mount points - I was using 'gnome-disk-utility' which automatically created a 30character mountpoint name(?) then I should be good
I reallly don't want to reinstall Arch again, after 2 days, finally got it working correctly ~ I still don't like how the SSD/HDD setup is though, 20gigs for root? and now these mountpoints 
Going to try this again, reformat the drives, reduce the partitions, then manually add new mountpoints in a minimal directory '/' or '/home',  here is what gnome added to '/etc/fstab'
'/dev/disk/by-uuid/b718cd7c-2328-494a-9c4e-724f5e96310d /mnt/b718cd7c-2328-494a-9c4e-724f5e96310d auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0'
https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/partitionmanager/partitionmanager/partitionmanager.pdf

if you do edit fstab manually, always be sure to run - this was the problem I had, I edited it manually, and then it crashed on reboot - wouldn't load mountpoints I created so used gnome-disk
sudo findmnt --verify --verbose
mount -a
Also just to add to conversation, there is a genfstab package that will generate fstab output based on what's currently mounted. You can redirect that output to the /etc/fstab file 
(-U means to use UUID for the mounts, / is the mount you want to use as the root filesystem):
genfstab -U / > /etc/fstab
