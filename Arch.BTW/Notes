found old USB used to install ubuntu, formatted it, downloaded arch iso from a torrent, verfied, and added to the reformatted usb to make a bootable usb for install

ran 'mkinitcpio -P' from chroot, missing a tonne of firmware, will need to fix, 
/etc/mkinitcpio.conf
'initramfs' #this is what broke on ubuntu, couldn't fix and was running without a GPU for ? who knows how long - maybe this is why blender was terrible?
found in '/boot' from chroot 'initramfs-linux.img' and backup
'arch.conf' also mentions microloader for intel and initramfs, it is the bootloader config file found in '/boot/loader/entries'
just finished final step of installation guide, installed the bootloader, and removed the bootable USB, and was greeted with 'Invalid Partition Table', It's 3:03 - taking a break

Ok, day 2, step 1 is to fix the wifi 
rfkill #checks wifi/bluetooth
rfkill unblock wlan #unblocks wifi
iwctl #puts it in wifi mode
modprobe -r rtl8723be
modprobe rtl8723be fwlps=0
device wlan0 Powered off #have you tried turning it off and on again? this seemed to work last time
device wlan0 Powered on
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect <network>
  enter <network> name, and then password, have it ready because I only have a few second window before it loses the network again (??)
