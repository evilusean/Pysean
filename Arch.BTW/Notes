found old USB used to install ubuntu, formatted it, downloaded arch iso from a torrent, verfied, and added to the reformatted usb to make a bootable usb for install

ran 'mkinitcpio -P' from chroot, missing a tonne of firmware, will need to fix, 
/etc/mkinitcpio.conf
'initramfs' #this is what broke on ubuntu, couldn't fix and was running without a GPU for ? who knows how long - maybe this is why blender was terrible?
found in '/boot' from chroot 'initramfs-linux.img' and backup
'arch.conf' also mentions microloader for intel and initramfs, it is the bootloader config file found in '/boot/loader/entries'
just finished final step of installation guide, installed the bootloader, and removed the bootable USB, and was greeted with 'Invalid Partition Table', It's 3:03 

Ok, day 2, step 1 is to fix the wifi 
rfkill #checks wifi/bluetooth
rfkill unblock wlan #unblocks wifi
iwctl #puts it in wifi mode
modprobe -r rtl8723be
modprobe rtl8723be fwlps=0
device wlan0 set-property Powered off #have you tried turning it off and on again? this seemed to work last time
device wlan0 set-property Powered on
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect <network>
  enter <network> name, and then password, have it ready because I only have a few second window before it loses the network again (??)

ran 'archinstall' after getting network set up, it allowed me to automatically suggest the partition layout
I tried to manually do it before, using a UEFI setup, and something broke, it fixed the SSD drives and added a boot partition, installing arch linux to sda now
Succesfully logged in, created a new user, and now playing around.. the only thing I see is a terminal, no GUI

after getting back into chroot from bootable usb, install these before leaving, internet doesn't work without, get everything installed from initial chroot
pacman -S <package name>

Adding second hard drive:

https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/k9ee1l/add_second_hdd_to_arch_linux_setup/
pacman -S gnome-disk-utility

Ok, finally got it - don't use /home as a seperate directory, use archinstall - Archon? ArchSean - Power Overwhelming.
Tried to reboot, wouldn't load, maybe you do need /home as a seperate directory, found out why my 20gig boot partition might be filling up too quick -
https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/q8e6lx/psa_clear_your_pacman_cache_i_freed_40_gb_by/
https://pacman.archlinux.page/pacman.conf.5.html
pacman -Scc

Tried to install some things overnight, everything still works, except - 
'/run/media/ArchSean/bc1e0382-20ad-43a4-ad0d-f1adc06926ad' the hard drives are weirdly named, and some things won't install
going to try to rename these drives / mountpoints the mountpoint is used for the install, and it's length is causing problems with getting my system functional again
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=289559
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Persistent_block_device_naming
I think if I reformat the drive(s), and add new mount points - I was using 'gnome-disk-utility' which automatically created a 30character mountpoint name(?) then I should be good
I reallly don't want to reinstall Arch again, after 2 days, finally got it working correctly ~ I still don't like how the SSD/HDD setup is though, 20gigs for root? and now these mountpoints 
Going to try this again, reformat the drives, reduce the partitions, then manually add new mountpoints in a minimal directory '/' or '/home',  here is what gnome added to '/etc/fstab'
'/dev/disk/by-uuid/b718cd7c-2328-494a-9c4e-724f5e96310d /mnt/b718cd7c-2328-494a-9c4e-724f5e96310d auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0'
https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/partitionmanager/partitionmanager/partitionmanager.pdf

if you do edit fstab manually, always be sure to run - this was the problem I had, I edited it manually, and then it crashed on reboot - wouldn't load mountpoints I created so used gnome-disk
sudo findmnt --verify --verbose
mount -a
Also just to add to conversation, there is a genfstab package that will generate fstab output based on what's currently mounted. You can redirect that output to the /etc/fstab file 
(-U means to use UUID for the mounts, / is the mount you want to use as the root filesystem):
genfstab -U / > /etc/fstab

https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/auto-mount-drives-without-password-kde/19335/3
Settings → Removable storage → Removable devices
Enable:
 Enable automatic mounting of removable media
 Automatically mount all removable media at login
 Automatically mount all removable media when attached
Apply
Reboot
For automounting non removable media at boot time just edit /etc/fstab and set the proper permissions as always.
After reading the wiki, I am using the systemd bootloader, and that is the mountpoint that is being used, maybe try a new bootloader and use gnome-disk-utility? or try it again manually?~

1: Have yay installed.
2: yay -S gnome-disk-utility.
3: Go and type in Disk in the search bar and it'll say "Disks Manage Drives and Media".
4: click on the drive you want to add on there and "Edit Mount Options".
5: Uncheck "User Session Defaults" and make sure "mount at system startup" and show in user interface are checked.
6: type in your credentials for it to edit the /etc/fstab file.
7: reboot and if you are on KDE Plasma at least (I don't know how the other ones are) it will be mounted under devices without asking for a password or anything.

NVIDIA GPU RESOURCES (why I started this entire eneavour to begin with):
https://rtfm.co.ua/en/arch-linux-nvidia-driver-installation-for-geforce-gtx-1050-ti/
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA
lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA | 3D)" #command for checking GPU 
01:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Mobile] (rev a1)
        Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Device 15e0
        Kernel driver in use: nouveau

Ok, I am downloading the files, and moving them when they are completed off the SSD, should fix the download issue, without messing with the disks/mounting

Also figured out a fix for the 'MAKEPKG' Error:
==> ERROR: Running makepkg as root is not allowed as it can cause permanent, catastrophic damage to your system.
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=85614
su -
pacman -Sy sudo
nano /etc/sudoers
Then find the following lines
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
and change them to
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
user ALL=(ALL) ALL
#can now install programs with MAKEPKG

Installed wine manually, works now, instead of using lutris installer, download the .exe, load through lutris manually, on the drive you want(HDD with phunky name worked this time)

found the problem:
/dev/sda2/usr # taking 7 / 10 gigs right here, if I can just move this directory, 70% of the root bloat will be gone
