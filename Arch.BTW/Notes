found old USB used to install ubuntu, formatted it, downloaded arch iso from a torrent, verfied, and added to the reformatted usb to make a bootable usb for install

ran 'mkinitcpio -P' from chroot, missing a tonne of firmware, will need to fix, 
/etc/mkinitcpio.conf
'initramfs' #this is what broke on ubuntu, couldn't fix and was running without a GPU for ? who knows how long - maybe this is why blender was terrible?
found in '/boot' from chroot 'initramfs-linux.img' and backup
'arch.conf' also mentions microloader for intel and initramfs, it is the bootloader config file found in '/boot/loader/entries'
just finished final step of installation guide, installed the bootloader, and removed the bootable USB, and was greeted with 'Invalid Partition Table', It's 3:03 

Ok, day 2, step 1 is to fix the wifi 
rfkill #checks wifi/bluetooth
rfkill unblock wlan #unblocks wifi
iwctl #puts it in wifi mode
modprobe -r rtl8723be
modprobe rtl8723be fwlps=0
device wlan0 set-property Powered off #have you tried turning it off and on again? this seemed to work last time
device wlan0 set-property Powered on
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect <network>
  enter <network> name, and then password, have it ready because I only have a few second window before it loses the network again (??)

ran 'archinstall' after getting network set up, it allowed me to automatically suggest the partition layout
I tried to manually do it before, using a UEFI setup, and something broke, it fixed the SSD drives and added a boot partition, installing arch linux to sda now
Succesfully logged in, created a new user, and now playing around.. the only thing I see is a terminal, no GUI

Adding second hard drive:
https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=255774
https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/k9ee1l/add_second_hdd_to_arch_linux_setup/
pacman -S gnome-disk-utility

Ok, finally got it - don't use /home as a seperate directory, use archinstall - Archon? ArchSean - Power Overwhelming.
Tried to reboot, wouldn't load, maybe you do need /home as a seperate directory, found out why my 20gig boot partition might be filling up too quick -
https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/q8e6lx/psa_clear_your_pacman_cache_i_freed_40_gb_by/
https://pacman.archlinux.page/pacman.conf.5.html
pacman -Scc

Tried to install some things overnight, everything still works, except - 
'/run/media/ArchSean/bc1e0382-20ad-43a4-ad0d-f1adc06926ad' the hard drives are weirdly named, and some things won't install
going to try to rename these drives / mountpoints the mountpoint is used for the install, and it's length is causing problems with getting my system functional again
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=289559
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Persistent_block_device_naming
I think if I reformat the drive(s), and add new mount points - I was using 'gnome-disk-utility' which automatically created a 30character mountpoint name(?) then I should be good
I reallly don't want to reinstall Arch again, after 2 days, finally got it working correctly ~ I still don't like how the SSD/HDD setup is though, 20gigs for root? and now these mountpoints 
Going to try this again, reformat the drives, reduce the partitions, then manually add new mountpoints in a minimal directory '/' or '/home',  here is what gnome added to '/etc/fstab'
'/dev/disk/by-uuid/b718cd7c-2328-494a-9c4e-724f5e96310d /mnt/b718cd7c-2328-494a-9c4e-724f5e96310d auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0'
https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/partitionmanager/partitionmanager/partitionmanager.pdf

if you do edit fstab manually, always be sure to run - this was the problem I had, I edited it manually, and then it crashed on reboot - wouldn't load mountpoints I created so used gnome-disk
sudo findmnt --verify --verbose
mount -a
Also just to add to conversation, there is a genfstab package that will generate fstab output based on what's currently mounted. You can redirect that output to the /etc/fstab file 
(-U means to use UUID for the mounts, / is the mount you want to use as the root filesystem):
genfstab -U / > /etc/fstab

https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/auto-mount-drives-without-password-kde/19335/3
Settings → Removable storage → Removable devices
Enable:
 Enable automatic mounting of removable media
 Automatically mount all removable media at login
 Automatically mount all removable media when attached
Apply
Reboot
For automounting non removable media at boot time just edit /etc/fstab and set the proper permissions as always.
After reading the wiki, I am using the systemd bootloader, and that is the mountpoint that is being used, maybe try a new bootloader and use gnome-disk-utility? or try it again manually?~

https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/k9ee1l/add_second_hdd_to_arch_linux_setup/
1: Have yay installed.
2: yay -S gnome-disk-utility.
3: Go and type in Disk in the search bar and it'll say "Disks Manage Drives and Media".
4: click on the drive you want to add on there and "Edit Mount Options".
5: Uncheck "User Session Defaults" and make sure "mount at system startup" and show in user interface are checked.
6: type in your credentials for it to edit the /etc/fstab file.
7: reboot and if you are on KDE Plasma at least (I don't know how the other ones are) it will be mounted under devices without asking for a password or anything.

Ok, I am downloading the files, and moving them when they are completed off the SSD, should fix the download issue, without messing with the disks/mounting

Also figured out a fix for the 'MAKEPKG' Error:
==> ERROR: Running makepkg as root is not allowed as it can cause permanent, catastrophic damage to your system.
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=85614
su -
pacman -Sy sudo
nano /etc/sudoers
Then find the following lines
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
and change them to
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
user ALL=(ALL) ALL
#can now install programs with MAKEPKG

Installed wine manually, works now, instead of using lutris installer, download the .exe, load through lutris manually, on the drive you want(HDD with phunky name worked this time)

found the problem - I really don't want to mess around with directories that are critical to boot, still got 10 gigs left, not critical - yet:
/dev/sda2/usr # taking 7 / 10 gigs right here, if I can just move this directory, 70% of the root bloat will be gone

Second day, everything booted correctly, most things installed, going to install Coqui-AI / OpenAI-Whisper and Anki. Get back to languages, Step 1) Escape.
Location of Python `pip` packages: '/home' #still have 80+ gigs on SSD for home, after reinstalling, don't have to worry about this going to '/root' - less than 10 left
pip show numpy #Location: /home/user/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages.
Both of these are >5 years old, both recomend pacman? - docs say if not using a venv, it can conflict with packages in /usr/ - which is on my root dir - which is already half full

Coqui-AI:

╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try 'pacman -S

    If you wish to install a non-Arch-packaged Python package,

I tried with pacman(file not found), without(big mad warning), now going to try with a venv to get around the warning -

python -m venv <envname>
python -m venv TranslaSean #created it in my 'PySean' repo that auto uploads to github, added a .gitignore to ignore it. Should be able to DL with pip now

source TranslaSean/bin/activate # nm, disregard last, this works to 'turn on' the venv - type this command to 'use' the venv, use it from the 'Pysean' directory
deactivate # type this to leave venv
tried to install using the command given from 'https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/tree/dev#installation' - 'pip install TTS' -  still won't work even after installing venv and updating pip
from docs: 'python >= 3.9, < 3.12..' - my python --version is 3.12.4 - is that it? just need to create a new venv with  reduced version of python?
https://gist.github.com/beci/53a08cb73ec8539b895a64bebbd49734
sudo pacman -S python3.9 #installing 3.9 with pacman - didn't work?

python    3.9 -m venv TranslaSean3.9 #creating the python 3.9 venv
source TranslaSean3.9/bin/activate #go into newly created venv
pip install TTS #works!
pip -m uninstall [packagename] #going to need to uninstall when TTS get's updated to work with newest version of python, each time I download - multiple gigs off of /root gone for each model
sudo pacman -S python-TTS # run this command every morning until it updates, if it doesn't after a week(2?) - you can use the venv method, tedious, but works - if it does DL = remove venv

CoquiAI - TTS : Pacman Workaround

Need to install all these before I can do the workaround with librosa

OpenAI Whisper : 
https://github.com/openai/whisper

Argos Translate - is free, runs locally, and is open source - Libre Translate is free, but an API (requires internet) and built on Argos translate - trying to install - sudo pacman won't work

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/argos-translate-git.git #installs the directory from above, trying the pacman workaround by using makepkg

sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5 #worked
sudo pacman -S python-stanza #didn't work
sudo pacman -S python-sentencepiece-git #didn't work
sudo pacman -S ctranslate2-git #didn't work 
Going to need to think about this before moving forward, 3/4 dependancies aren't installing with sudo pacman - Do I need to do the work around for each of them and THEIR OWN dependancies?
After doing the work around for each dependancy, worked out well, only problem is with ctranslate-2 - 2 versions? which one - and the first one is 5 Gigs! 
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-ctranslate2 #updated 2024, 5 gigs, massive. 
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-ctranslate2-git # hasn't been updated since 2022~ version recomended by makepkg, if I don't have it will it still work? 
going to go with the 2024 updated model, if it doesn't work - how to remove? not using pacman - doing workaround

error: Partition / too full: 1289755 blocks needed, 1120704 blocks free

Having problems with installing ctranslate2 and its dependancy cuda, I knew I was going to run out of space, here is how to mount /usr on a seperate drive (replace /opt/var/home):
mkdir /mnt/extra
mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/extra
mkdir /mnt/extra/opt
mkdir /mnt/extra/var
mkdir /mnt/extra/home
mount --bind /mnt/extra/opt /opt
mount --bind /mnt/extra/var /var
mount --bind /mnt/extra/home /home

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LVM
I still don't want to mess around with /usr after finally getting arch linux up and running after 3 days of trying to fix the drives, 
I don't actually need translate with STT - if it saves it as a .csv and a .txt, I can just copy and paste the .txt into google translate - use the .csv/.srt for reading/watching/timestamps
It was more of a nice to have, take one audio of slovak - transcribe slovak text and english to a csv, also having an option for english/slovak .srt subtitles, would of been nice-can do w/o
Going to clean cache, try to remove all the recently installed packages, just wasted last hour(s?) trying to get translation to work, would of been cool - can do without
