having some problems with ubuntu (crashes, terminal got messed up, SSD filled with misc garbage, etc) and now my GPU isn't being read by ubuntu, 
instead of reinstalling ubuntu to fix the many issues, I'm going to just install arch and work on that for a few weeks, everything I used should work on the new OS
will just need to reinstall it again, this time, hopefully with a working GPU. going to start moving all my stuff over to an external harddrive and reinstalling tommorrow.
