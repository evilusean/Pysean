A central file for remembering where all my custom keybindings and scripts are (in the very unlikely event I need to reinstall Arch, again, Btw) :
Settings ->  Keyboard » Customise Shortcuts » Custom Shortcuts » +
'Ctrl' + ';' = xsel > /tmp/speak.txt | festival --tts /tmp/speak.txt | pkill xsel #one liner for macro keybind 'Ctrl + ';'
'Ctrl' + ''' = pkill audsp #one liner to stop festival 'Ctrl' + '''
