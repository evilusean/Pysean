#A file for creating a japanese number convertor to test myself, will need range and conversion from
# numeric to written japanese both hiragana, kanji, and romaji(English) versions, remember that Japanese is weird
#it starts at 4 digits instead of 3 for man, etc,  so will need special rules, 
#will need an input range, larger numbers are harder, but still might need to practice 1-100, etc
