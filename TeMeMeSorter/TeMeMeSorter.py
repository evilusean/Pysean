#create a python script for sorting memes from one folder into many folders(25) 
#and I can press a key to send it to the folder, I will also need on the GUI a display of the key to press with 
#a folder location - the folders already exist, I need to transfer into them, 
#the folders all have unique names that are different, add custom mapping to keys and folders and 
#then display the key mapping in the gui below where the image will be displayed
#create a custom csv with key mappings and folder locations, use that for input
#take the custom mapping and display it in the GUI
#then take the images one by one to display in the GUI, take the mapping and then sort to correct folder
#afer being sorted, delete the old image from the unsorted folder and move the new image to correct folder
#add an undo button, I will inevitably press the wrong key
#'Next/Skip' Button
#if feeling ambitious, add a gif sort function that auto takes all gifs to 'gifs' folder
#if feeling very ambitious, create a hashing algo that checks for dups(I know there is a ton) - future sean problem
