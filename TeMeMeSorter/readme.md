Creating a repo for 'TeMeMeSorter' or colloquially known as 'The Meme Sorter' - since arch linux won't let me click and drag images to the correct directories, </br>
I need another OpSean. It should be pretty simple, go through a folder with all my unsorted memes, and then sort them into another folder based on which key was pressed, </br>
so I need a GUI, and OS/Shutil, some time to think how to build</br>
