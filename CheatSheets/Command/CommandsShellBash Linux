ls --help #Add --help flag to get more information on list command such as summary and potential flag parameters
man ls #Manual Command; used to show manual pages to get more information on list command such as summary and potential flag parameters

Command History(Linux):
history #shows a list of commands you have typed out recently
  You can scroll through recent commands by pressing 'Up' or 'Down' arrows on keyboard
Ctrl + R #history shortcut: shows recent commands used, start typing a part of recently used command for autofill
clear #clears output on screen

Listing Files(Bash/Linux):
ls / #lists all directorys under root directory
ls -l / #-l long flag, shows detailed information(dates/size/file permissions/owner/size) of files in the format of a long list
ls -a / #-a All flag, shows all files in a directory including hidden files
Important Directories in Linux:
  /bin #stores essential binaries/programs
  /etc #stores important system configuration files
  /home #personal directory for Users
  /proc #contains information about currently running processes
  /usr #For user installed software
  /var #stores system logs

Changing Directories(Linux Bash same as Windows '/'):
pwd #print working directory
cd #change directory
cd C:/Home/Sean/Documents #changes directory to absolute path of documents
cd ../Documents #uses relative path to change to documents folder
cd ~ /Desktop #takes you to home directory and then to /Desktop directory in it
cd ../D <tab> #tab completion type 'D' press tab and it will print all that start with 'D'
Creating Directories(Linux):
mkdir #make directory
mkdir New_Folder #makes a folder named 'New_Folder' in current working directory
mkdir New/ Folder #linux command can not interpret spaces, use '/' forwardslash is an escape character in linux, or quotes 'New Folder'
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 #creates multiple directories
  -p # allow mkdir to create parent directories if they don't exist
  -m # (mode) used to set permissions of directories during creation
  -v # run command in verbose mode
touch empty_file #creates file named empty_file
  -c # do not create file if it doesn't exist

Copying Files and Directories(Linux):
Ctrl + C #copy hotkey Ctrl + V #Paste hotkey

Copying Files and Directories(Linux):
Ctrl + C #copy hotkey Ctrl + V #Paste hotkey
cp #copy command
cp mycoolfile.txt ~/Desktop #copies mycoolfile.txt to the desktop, requires location as an argument to where it should copy to
cp *.jpg ~/Desktop #copies all files that end with .jpg to desktop
  Wildcard=A character that's used to help select files based on a certain pattern '*' asterisk=anything in windows
cp -r 'Directory Name' ~/Desktop #-r Recurse parameter allows you to copy all the contents in a directory
cp -r -v 'Directory Name' ~/Desktop #-v Verbose parameter prints a line for each item being copied
cp /home/user/source_file /home/user/duplicates/target_file #copies source file to target file

Moving/Renaming Files(Linux):
mv #move item command, allows you to rename a file
mv blue_document.txt ~/Documents #moves blue_document into documents folder
mv *_document.txt ~/Desktop #moves ALL _document.txt files to desktop
mv /home/user/source_file /home/user/moved_files/target_file #moves source file to target file

Removing Files and Directories(Linux):
rm #remove command
rm text1.txt #removes text1.txt
rm -r misc_folder #-r Recursive flag: to remove a folder you must do it recursively
rm -r non_empty_dir # removes non empty directory
rm /home/user/duplicates/target_file #removes target file

Display File Contents(Linux):
cat #concatonate command, used to view files
cat text_file.txt #dumps entire contents of file
head randomtext.txt #shows the first 10 lines of a file
tail randomtext.txt #shows last 10 lines of a file

less #displays file one page at a time
less document.txt #displays one page of document.txt, one terminal window at a time
less /path/to/file/file_name
  You can interact with the less command file
  Up and Down Keys=Advances one line at a time
  PageUp/PageDown=Advances through one page at a time
  g=Advances to the beginning of a file
  G=Advances to the end of a file
  /word_search=Allows you to search for a word or a phrase
  /<word you want to search>
  Q=Quits the file and returns to shell

Modifying Text Files(Linux):
nano filename.txt #opens a file in nano text editor, VIM for linux chads
nano /path/to/existing/file # opens file
  Ctrl(^)+G = Get Help
  Ctrl(^)+K = Cut Text
  Ctrl(^)+X = Exit
  CTRL(^)-O = Save

Searching Within Files(Linux):
grep #command that allows searching with RegularExpressions(RegEx)
grep word randomtext.txt #finds word in randomtext.txt and prints line if matches
grep word *.txt #searches all text files for a word that matches
  -r: search recursively
  -w: match the whole word
  -n: only in line number
  -e: match pattern
  --include and --exclude: include and exclude files in the search
  --include-dir and --exclude-dir: include or exclude directories in the search

Input, Output, Pipeline(Linux):
echo woof > dog.txt #prints 'woof' to dog.txt, '>'=redirector operator, sends output to file instead of screen, if file doesn't exist-it creates
echo woof >> dog.txt #If you don't want to overwrite a file use '>>' to append to a file
< #stdin operator, allows you to get input from files
ls /dir/fake_dir 2> error_output.txt #sends error message to error_output.txt
less /var/log/syslog 2> /dev/null #/dev/null file is used to filter out error messages(null)
ls -la /etc | grep bluetooth #takes output to see how many files in directory /etc have 'bluetooth'

Users/Groups (Linux):
Root User #created when linux installed, has unlimited access to machine
su #substitute user command allows you to change to a different user
sudo #grants superuser privileges
superuser do #grants superuser privileges
cat sudo /etc/group #view who is a member of each group 4 tags seperated by colons; groupname:password:groupID:users in group
cat /etc/passwd #shows encrypted passwords for users

Change Passwords(Linux):
passwd <username> #changes password for <username>, asks for current and new, stores in /etc/shadow can only be read in root encrypted
sudo passwd <username> -e #expired flag, forces a user to reset their new password

Add/Remove User(Linux):
sudo useradd <username> #adds a user, with basic configurations and home directory
sudo userdel <username> #deletes a user

File Permissions(Linux):
Linux permissions are seperated into sets of 3; first trio refers to permission of owner of file/second trio=group permissions/third=all other user
  -Owner: u
  -Group: g
  -All other Users: o
ls -l my_cool_file #shows permissions of a file
chmod #change mode command: change file access permissions 3x types: owner 'u', group 'g', other users 'o', Use + or - for permissions
chmod u+x my_cool_file #gives file owner 'u' executable permissions 'x'
chmod u-x my_cool_file #removes executable permission from owner
chmod ugo+r my_cool_file #gives everyone read permissions
chmod 754 my_cool_file #gives permissions 754=Owner(rwx, 7),Group(rx, 5),Other Users(4, r)
Numerical Format: 
  -Read(4, r): Allows someone to read the contents of a file or folder
  -Write(2, w): Allows someone to write information to a file or folder
  -Execute(1, x): Allows someone to execute a program
sudo chown sean my_cool_file #change owner command; changes owner of a file to sean
sudo chgrp some_group my_cool_file #change group command; changes group of a file
sudo chmod u+s my_cool_file #Enables 's' SetUID special permission bit that is used to allow a file to be run as the owner of the file
sudo chmod g+s <file> #SetGID(SetGroupID) special permission to allow it to to run as a group ID
sudo chmod +t my_folder #'t'=stickybits allows you to write to a file but not delete
sudo chmod a+r not_so_important_document #use "a+r". This adds read permission to everyone (owner, group, and other).
sudo chmod 764 not_so_important_document #numerical format to give all neccesary permissions quicker
sudo chmod a+rwx public_document #gives all read write execute permissions
sudo chmod 777 public_document #numerical way to give all permissions to everyone

Installing Software Packages(Linux Debian):

sudo apt update #updates list of packages in software repository
sudo apt upgrade #installs any outdated packages , run after update

Installing Devices/Drivers(Linux):
From the command-line, enter $ lpadmin -p printername -m driverfilename.ppd 
Lpadmin #is the printer administrator command.
The -p printername command adds or modifies the named printer. 
The -m driverfilename.ppd command installs the postscript printer description (PPD) driver filename that you provide. 
  The file should be stored in the /usr/share/cups/model/ directory.
Enter $ man lpadmin to open the manual for the lpadmin command to find additional command line options.
#The most common way to check if a device is installed is to use the “ls” (lowercase L and S) command, which means “list”. 
$ ls /dev #- Lists all devices in the /dev folder 
$ lscpci #- Lists devices installed on the PCI bus 
$ lsusb #- Lists devices installed on the USB bus
$ lsscsi #- Lists SCSI devices, such as hard drives
$ lpstat -p #- Lists all printers and whether they are enabled
$ dmesg #- Lists devices recognized by the kernel
