FHS 3(Filesystem Hierarchy Standard):
cd #change directory
cd / #goes to root
ls #lists all files in directory
$PATH #tell linux where to find executables
which #finds out which binary is being used, where it is located
~ #home directory
inxi -CGm # shows all your computer specs
btop # linux task manager
htop # linux task manager but pretty

/bin #contains binaries/executables
/sbin #contains system binaries, should only be executed by rootuser/SUDO
/lib #shared code between binaries
/usr 
  /bin #non essential user installed binaries/executables
  /sbin #same as sbin above, non essential user system binaries
  /local/bin #locally compiled binaries, safe place, won't conflict with other binaries
/etc #Et Cetera, Editable Text Config, .conf, 
/home #a folder for each user registered for each user
/boot #contains files needed to boot the system
/dev #device files, hardware/drivers
/opt #optional or addon software, rarely used
/var #variable files, change as OS is used, logs and cache files
/temp #temporary files, will be gone each reboot
/proc #doesn't exist on disk, created in memory
