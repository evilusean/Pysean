most fundamental way to layout a widget is with a container like a <div> in html, you can add margin and padding, 
There is a padding widget
Sizedbox widget for a fixed width and height
decoration: #property allows you to customize look on different widgets (border, gradient, shape, shadow, etc)
wrap with center #allows you to center an object/widget/container
Flex layout: Row(horizontally, X main axis, Y cross axis) vs Column(vertically)
  body: Column( children:[...]) #unlike a container(1 widget as a child), a container can take multiple children as a list
  mainAxisAlignment: Vs crossAxisAlignment: #change spacing between the children by modifying these
  Flexible Vs Expanded(flex: 4,) #Widgets, by default each child takes up the same amount of space, that can be changed with these widgets
  body: Stack(...) #allows an element to float on top of another, takes a row of children as an argument
trailing commas, keep code clean when you format document will only add one line instead of multiple lines
Positioned(..) #widget comparable to absolute positioning in CSS
Align(...) #widget comparable to relative positioning in CSS
home: Scaffold(...) #in built UI elements
onpressed: ({...}) #event handler, can add a function
bottomNavigationBar: #creates a bottom bar navigate widget with multiple children
drawer: Drawer(...) #creates a side drop down menu
body: ListView(...) #takes a list of children as an argument, but can scroll between them
builders #allow many widgets to be built dynamically
State #flutter can use many different states, Stateless, state(mutable data), reactive, provider package, bloc, cubit
setState(( { count++}); #creates a variable that adds to count
'$count' #calls data from count variable with '$' dollar sign
navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => AboutScreen(), #navigates to the About Screen
Hero #widget that adds animation
